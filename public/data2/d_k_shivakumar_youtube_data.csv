 Congress is trying to get rid of the second wave. In this situation, it is possible that the Bandaayi will win. To give tickets to our leaders, a high drama has been played in front of KPCC. Some have taken poison bottles. If you don't give, we will give you. You see what happened. Congress's Bandaayi's Birugali. High drama in front of KKCC. DK Shiv Kumar, who says that we all are suffering. Congress's second wave has been hit by Bandaayi's Birugali. In the second wave, the people of Madiwada community, Gopi Krishna, wanted to give tickets to them. In front of Congress, the people of the community protested. They took poison bottles. On the other hand, they put up a protest against the Congress leader. You are giving MLC. You are doing everything. You are saying that. They are doing it for us. This should not happen. We are trying to give justice to the people of this country. A protest to give tickets to Gopalakrishna. Sidhu, DKS, put up a protest. Not only in the second wave, in the Kolkata-Molakalmur area, to give tickets to Gopalakrishna, Yogesh Babu Bembali, held a huge protest. DK Shiv Kumar, put up a protest like Sidhu Ramayya. In the middle of the protest, BJP's former government, Gopalakrishna, joined Congress. For this, Yogesh Babu Bembali, protested. In one hand, Yogesh Babu Bembali, and Gopalakrishna Bembali, joined hands and went to the end. When Congress left, Congress did not win. The reason for this is, Congress is always on Gopalakrishna's side. Today, because he joined the Molakalmur area, all the castes and communities, have a lot of power from him. If our poor people, come to the KPCC office, today, Yogesh Babu, I will tell you with my heart. About the ticket protest, the protest leader, KPCC's DKS Shiv Kumar, and the work leader, Salim Ahmed, said, ""We will fix all the problems, that is not a protest, we will put it up."" We will put it up. We believe in him. There is a community of 17 members. The decision will be made by the CEC. They can be there. There should be a support. It is not unnecessary. It will be done. They will talk. They will talk. We will give tickets to the social workers. This is not a protest. This is a protest. The Congress, which left the first batch, had a big headache for the second batch. Congress has put its hand on the head of the head. Srinivas Rao, Public TV, Bengaluru."

 The CMs are always fooling people. They gave a bus pass to the PM, they talked about the manifesto, but their budget is over. Nothing is left. Now you get the reservation. I announced in the election that I will give the ST category to the Koli community. I called Baburao Chitrasura and asked him to speak. Baburao Chitrasura said that he is happy with the ST category. We asked the lawyers for 15% and 15% and they said that they will give us 2% of the ST category. I said that we are not satisfied with the 2% that the Congress Party gave us.

See, the people are suffering, they are suffering. Now we will control all the prices, we will double the profit. They have done so much. We have helped them. We have given them 10 kgs of rice, 200 units of power, 2000 rupees for every woman. For the educated and educated youth, who are not able to get a job, the private sector should help them, they should create jobs. They should be given 3000 rupees. This is the guarantee of the Congress party. We have acted according to our duty. We will hide it. You have said that you will not do it. I am saying that you should take the paper advertisement on the 10th. I will take it and put it in front of you. Why did you tell them? Why did you say that you will give power from 7 to 10 o'clock? Why did you say that you will do salamanna? Will they do it or will I do it? We have not told the government anything. You have been in the government for 3-4 years. Why can't you do it? Yesterday, in the Madhavi inquiry, they gave an answer. Where is Madhavi? She is still in the Supreme Court. We have not given her a chance. You have done a great job there. Home Minister has also said that you have done a great job. You have patched up both the governments. Home Minister has also said that. Prahlad Joshi is the CNC. Where is Madhavi? I have tweeted the reply yesterday. They have given a reply. Goa government has tweeted that it has changed. From today, the government will start on the last day. You can wait. They will take 60-65 seats. Congress will not give you a seat. I am telling you this with a lot of respect. I am telling you this as a general rule. You are talking to the MLA's and saying that in the next 100 seats, we will give you a seat. All MLA's are right. You are talking to all BJP MLA's. They are coming to find out. I am not the one who has to accommodate them. They are coming to us to find out where we are. They are saying that they are not in the candidates and that is why they are calling us. No, they are the ones who are looking for seats. How did they do the government? How did they do the government? Our candidates have been accepted and the government is being done. Is the BJP government being done? Pollution government is being done. They are saying that the CM is in which party? They are saying that the CM is in which party? So BJP is running with the people and Congress. How much will you get from BJP? I am not going to say anything. I don't want to damage them. Are you calling them, sir? We will see where we can accommodate them. Are you calling them, sir? NEWS FIRST"

 We should have heard here is Praveen Sood, the decorated police officer, the DG, IGP of Karnataka. He's been threatened by the Congress Chief, DK Shiv Kumar, saying if we come to power, we're going to throw you out. Allegations are that Praveen Sood is working in favor of your government. Look, DK Shiv Kumar, after coming back from jail, he has lost his mind. He doesn't know what to say, what not to say. KPCC President Jaita, who made him, the people of Karnataka are very surprised. Because Praveen Sood is a very prompt and honest officer. He doesn't have an agent from KPCC or Congress. Whatever Praveen Sood is doing, he's doing it legally. He won't do anything illegal. No influence will go on him. If you call a police officer like DK Shiv Kumar a scoundrel, he's a scoundrel. I know what he doesn't know. He has said one more thing. After the Congress government comes, he's saying, ""Look what we're going to do."" Congress government will not come to Karnataka at any time. He doesn't know. He's saying, ""We'll do this, we'll do that, we'll give Rs. 2000 to every lady, we'll give 200 units of power."" He's saying all this because Congress government will not come to Karnataka at any time. That's why he's saying this. He has made a statement about Praveen Sood. He has insulted the police officers and all the officers. He is immediately asking for forgiveness from the officers. DK Shiv Kumar, this is my demand. DK Shiv Kumar is saying that Praveen Sood listens to your BJP. He targets Congress every time. This is a political stooge. Look, Nalpand fought in the bar. He fought in the bar and Nalpand, the youth congressman, the state president, he was arrested and put in the police department. That's why the police officers of Karnataka are doing a good job, a good job. That's why they are getting scared of the police. That's why DK Shiv Kumar keeps saying something or the other. Thank you very much, Eeshwarappa, for joining us on that. It's KS Eeshwarappa, Karnataka's BJP MLA, who is certain that the Congress will not come to power in Karnataka, whatever happens. He calls DK Shiv Kumar the man himself as Nalai. Well, the poll season, of course, heating up. Sagai Raj, if we can see here, the war of words between the BJP and the Congress really intensifying ahead of assembly elections. KS Eeshwarappa, as we know, speaks his mind. He said what he had to say, calls DK Shiv Kumar the Nalai one. But, you know, whatever jibes aside, what exactly is the allegation here against Praveen Sood? Could you give us an example with cases here? Notice that, as I rightly pointed out, there was a campaign which was being started by Congress against BJP government. That is called Pay CM campaign. And there were posters which were being put out in every nook and corner of Bengaluru. And later on, it was extended to all the other districts. And apart from that, there are several other campaigns which have been done by social media as well as the other Congress workers. But even if they protest, there are several cases which have been registered against Congress workers, against the BJP government. But when it comes to BJP, the Congress is alleging that there are no cases registered, there are no actions being taken. For an example, Nabila, when it comes to Ramesh Jarke Oli case, there was a clear evidence according to Congress. And they have also said that there was an FIR registered. But there was no arrest made in that particular case. And even if you notice, in Maudal Virupaksha's case, Maudal Virupaksha's son was caught red-handed. Maudal Virupaksha MLA, he is the A1 in that particular case. And there was no arrest being made by the police, despite for more than three days. And later on, the MLA himself said that he was at home, there was no questioning which was done, there was no summons issued by the police. They just asked him to give a statement. And he stepped out only after the anti-spatiary bill. So these are the accusations from the Congress stating that time and again, the DGP and the police attacks the Congress, register cases against the Congress. But when it comes to BJP, they are not taking any action against their leaders and there are no arrests made by the police on the BJP leaders."

 We are ready since 3 months. BJP, Government, Government advertisement, paper advertisement, all are ready to close. They are doing the election for their own benefit. We are ready since 3 months. Congress should announce the result of the election as soon as possible. The Government has done all the necessary work. They have done all the work against the law. How is the anger on the reservation court? The people who are the main ministers of the village, the people who are standing in front of them, how is the anger on them? You have seen it with your own eyes. Even the people of this village are not a part of the society. They are creating problems for the society and are doing all this against the law. If they go to the courts, they will not stand. But what can they do? [Outro Music]"

 Mani Sri Chalwai Swami, our Hidiya Nayakaratha Ravan, Ravan has sat there, there is no place here. Narayana Swami is there, our Vijayam Noor is there, Babu is there for everyone. Today, I too have come to Srinagar twice, from Karnataka, Dhruvarayana, and from far away, I have come to Mundukai. Today, I am travelling in this train from the morning. We searched for you from far away in the Kadaga Chunavani. Today, I have faith that from far away, Rameshwari will be there. I am doing my marriage as a party. People, BJP, Congress, hey, come here, the vehicle is stopped, keep quiet. I am doing my marriage for everyone. We gave Kumar Swami an opportunity in the last election, even though the Congress party took 38 seats, we gave him an opportunity. We gave him the right to do it, and we gave him the right to keep BJP away. He could not do it. After that election, he is still running for the Suni Deva. He has given the Rajya to Gopi Srinivas, he has given the Rajya to our Srinivas, Gola Rao. He has given the Rajya to Dattar, he has given the Rajya to Madhubandhara Rao. Today, a lot of people have come. People who have been working for a long time, they have given the Rajya to me, they have given the Rajya to Srinivas. One year he was the M.Sc., Babu Raj Chunchanswari, she was also the M.Sc. for one year. Today, she has come from BJP. There is a lot of people here. Even if there are more people, I will take them all. He has become the M.Sc. He has become the M.Sc. He has become the M.Sc. of Karnataka. He has also become the M.Sc. of Rajya. Because, in the elections, he has given the Rajya to Puri Babu Rajyapati and Madhubandhara Rao. He has won this time also. Even after winning, he has won the M.Sc. of Karnataka. He has won the M.Sc. of Rajya. I have heard about him. I have heard about him. He has won this time. I have heard about him. He has won this time. He has won this time. He has won this time. He has won this time. He has won this time. He has won this time. He has won this time. He has won this time. He has won this time. He has won this time. All the factories, fields, petrol, gas, everything has been destroyed. The government has not helped anyone. Neither the BJP nor the Dalit people have helped. No one has heard about this. That is why we have come here today to ask the people to go to the highway and pay the toll. Today, BJP has given Rs.15 lakhs to the people. Is that enough? This is a corrupt government. This is a corrupt government. Look at the national level. It is half and half. That is why the CM is doing this. What should be done? The people who do business have not given a place to the toilet. No one has heard about this. No one has done anything. I am asking you to do the same. The Congress party has given you the power to do whatever you want. We are the Congress party. All your families have to pay the power bill. All the women and children are in need. All the women and children are in need. All the women and children are in need. We are asking you to give us your phone number. We will give you the DC office. I am talking to you from a different place. I am talking to you from Ranganath.

 The current state of affairs is to finalize the opposition. We were also talking about Varanasi. What is happening in the BJP core committee is that there are four leaders in the BJP. One is in Congress. But now, when we look at the BJP's inquiry, the BJP leader is a great man. In the second, the BJP core committee's inside story. We are seeing some great investigations in the BJP core committee. Ramesh Garam in the name of the BJP leader. Ramesh Sharkeyhuli, who has been eagerly waiting to buy tickets for Mahesh Kumteli. If we had come, would the government have done it? Your government was created because so many rulers have shifted from there. Ramesh Sharkeyhuli, who is angry with the BJP leader. Ramesh Sharkeyhuli's power is BSY Garam. If you are angry, you will have to face the consequences. There is no chance to be angry in the core committee. If you want to face the consequences, BSY Garam is there. Balachandra Sharkeyhuli, who has asked for Ramesh's forgiveness. In the BJP's core committee, in the core committee's meeting, Pralaj Joshi comes in the morning. He talks. He talks and talks and stands in front of the light. BSY also made Garam. Ramesh Sharkeyhuli, who is the leader of the BJP, has spoken in the core committee's meeting today. Don't give false statements. BJP's state leader Nalin Kumar Katel has given this notice to the district leader. No one should give false statements. In the BJP's core committee's meeting, Ramesh Sharkeyhuli came in the occasion of talking in the evening. He will give a lecture on Kirani. In direct contact with Kirani, if the government should be created, Ramesh Sharkeyhuli's role is very important. So, we cannot repeat the same thought over and over again. Or, it will be difficult to keep it in front and hold on to the ticket. Because, it is a complicated area. On one side is Lakshman Saudi and on the other side is Mahesh Kumtale. What exactly happened in today's meeting? What did Ramesh Sharkeyhuli express in a loud voice? How was BSY's reaction? Avinash, in yesterday's morning BJP's core committee's meeting, this thought was presented. Shastri Ramesh Sharkeyhuli was so angry. After hearing that thought, the CM, Adhirappa Garam, and yesterday evening's BJP's Belgavi district's core committee all came to this meeting. Yesterday, in the occasion of the meeting, when the ticket was presented, Shastri Ramesh Sharkeyhuli was so angry. Because, he was the Prime Minister, and he had demanded to get the ticket this time also. In the occasion of his anger, when Ramesh Sharkeyhuli was angry, the members of the Belgavi district's core committee were so angry. Ramesh Sharkeyhuli, not only in the Athanik Kshetra, but also in the Nippanik Kshetra, he had made such a complaint. Yesterday, in the occasion of the complaint made by the core committee members, there was a lot of commotion in the assembly. Because of that commotion, the members of the BJP's Samsadiya Mandali, Adhirappa B.S. and Garam, because, even if they say something like 'summa neriya', when the complaints and commotions were coming forward, in that occasion, Shastri Ramesh Sharkeyhuli, if we had come, if I, Mahesh Kumteli and others had come, if you had done the government, if you had made the security, in that way, in the occasion of such a loud speech, the members of the BJP, even Adhirappa B.S. and Garam, if you had kept quiet in that occasion, they would have taken the action against you. Such a warning, BJP's district's core committee, that is, the members of the Belgavi district's core committee, they gave such a warning. In this occasion, Shastri Balachandra Sharkeyhuli, his brother and Shastri Ramesh Sharkeyhuli, even in the assembly, they gave an apology. That is, for the words that Ramesh Sharkeyhuli said, for the words that he said, that he will not give any warning to the core committee members, that is, what is the incident here, in that incident, even after leaving the assembly, in any way, they did not give any warning that they would not give any apology. Such a warning, even to the core committee members, they gave to the assembly. Here, in Nippanikshetra, BJP, in the thought of defeating the best party, for the past two years, Ramesh Sharkeyhuli is trying. This is, in fact, the Nippanikshetra Shastri, Shashikala Jolly and his apology was the reason. This is the first time in the assembly, in the present time, they have raised this issue. In the time when Ramesh Sharkeyhuli was in the city, in the Nippanikshetra, Shastri Jolly, and some of the core committee members, they too, against Ramesh Sharkeyhuli, have raised an apology. For that reason, yesterday, there was a fight. Later, they raised the issue, and Ramesh Sharkeyhuli, and Balachand Sharkeyhulu, have apologized. This is what happened in the yesterday's assembly."

KPCC's President DK Shukumar's spot talk Who has spoken, what has he spoken, very interesting, shocking and breaking For the Congress party, DKC is out, that is what is being said here For the Congress party, DKC is out, that is the Congress leader DK Shukumar is supporting, that is said to be very difficult DK Shukumar is not my type, that is said by a Muthsaddi Nayaka Very interesting, really Now a days, when the politics of forest, forest politics, When the Sikabate is doing Sudhi, Sadh, when the discussion is going on DK Shukumar is being supported, that is said to be very difficult If CM is coming to ask questions, I vote for Sidhramayya His words, my respect, DK Shukumar is not my type Now, the President of the same party, the same Nayaka is being said Who is that, the one who has joined the party, the old Datta, the spot talk The old Datta, who has joined the Congress from GDS, has formed his own importance and personality In Kadur, DKC has expressed his anger, his words are very clear Datta has expressed his anger by making me an MLC, he has expressed his pain The old Datta, who has joined the Congress from GDS, has formed his own importance and personality He has expressed his anger by making me an MLC, he has expressed his pain He has expressed his anger by making me an MLC, he has expressed his pain He has expressed his anger by making me an MLC, he has expressed his pain He has expressed his anger by making me an MLC, he has expressed his pain He has expressed his anger by making me an MLC, he has expressed his pain He has expressed his anger by making me an MLC, he has expressed his pain In that, if corruption comes, DKC will not be able to justify everything That is the words of the old Datta, who has joined the Congress So, what other opinions can be expressed? How is this damage control done in the party? Are the allegations of DKC Kumar on Suryamalai being blamed? So, how much will this Bannerajkiya rise in the party? Yes, it is very difficult to accept DKC Kumar In my constituency, the most important thing is Kurup bro See, in the people's government, caste politics is in which way How it is going, one is because of finalizing the ticket Even till the vote is cast, caste, caste, caste is seen above the caste That is the reality See, the most important thing in my constituency is Kurup bro What Sidramaiah says there is the same After the election, if you ask the CM, I will say Sidramaiah, you should say In that, he has given up his real and fake position DKC Kumar knows that Datta is 100% Sidramaiah In my constituency, DKC has created a Congress candidate against me They have told Anand to give you the ticket Don't think, Datta is saying that he will make me an MLC Because, this is the law of the land Congress candidate for the first time in the history of the world, Magi CM Opposition leader, Sidramaiah is saying So, in the case of the lobbies, till this spot, which kind of party will be created? One survey, even if they come against me, they will not give the ticket Best suggestion, survey it and decide I did that and told Shiv Kumar that it is good I will not go to talk about DK Don't see DK as Shiv Kumar, only see him as the party president Because, in the audio clip, many questions were raised What is the nature of the leftists? How does the Bannerajkiya sound? When there is no unity, how does the victory happen? All these questions can be seen in the politics DK Shiv Kumar, is the only candidate for the Congress He is the burden to the party If DK wants to support Sidramaiah, he will be in trouble Sidramaiah cannot support him But, he is going to the party as a necessity They have talked about it in the media Even if there are allegations against our Congress leaders, they cannot do it alone Sidramaiah can tell to do it alone But, it will be difficult to say DK When it comes to Shiv Kumar, it is very difficult to support him It is seen that the words are very authentic But, in the future, it will give some bad results Now, Shiv Kumar was very corrupt He was corrupt in the time of S M Krishna All these words are being said It may be for the people or for the Mathadars But, when we consider it as normal He is his party, he is his party In one side, there are their parties What is there in the audio clip? What is the real question? My student is in trouble It is difficult to accept DK Shiv Kumar I will tell the truth I am not able to get along with a party system I have told everything Now, I have the same problem in Kshetra The one who has decided my Kshetra ticket is Sidramaiah That is my deep constituency Whatever Sidramaiah says, that may be final Till now, Sidramaiah has been doing it in the Congress Sidramaiah was the one who was begging me to get the ticket Sidramaiah is the one who did it for me One day, after the election, if you vote for someone I will tell Sidramaiah That is my condition DK Shiv Kumar knows that Dutta is 100% Sidramaiah's man He has done a lot of effort There, against me A Congress candidate has been born Kurban, Anand I will give him your ticket, he will not think Dutta will do MLC, he will give you a good position I did not say anything Once, I went to Shiv Kumar's house Before joining the Congress Sidramaiah told me I went to the President to do Kanu Shastra We spoke for half an hour I did not say anything I am also joining the Congress Party I have not put a condition, I am joining with a lot of blood The desire for the ticket is true Because in my constituency People are expecting me to win a Congress seat That is why I am eager You do one thing, survey me I have not asked you to do it Do a survey, do 50 surveys In those 50 surveys If I get 49 surveys If one survey is against me, do not give me the ticket 50 surveys People's opinion If you give me the ticket, I will win the Congress seat That is all I have come to say I surveyed the guest house services I did all the interviews, police reports, surveys If I give 10, I will win the Congress seat I did not go to talk about DK I did not go to make tiffin or to do DK I kept quiet Many people come to me They ask me to go to DK I told them to beg I told them to shoot DK I told them to do it immediately Is DK Congress liability? Liability Liability Sidhramayya is a socialist In the Congress party When he is in the assembly When compared to Sidhramayya We are nothing If Sidhramayya wants to defend DK He will shoot If Sidhramayya wants to do all the interviews If he is subjected to a small question He will not be able to defend the politics That is the truth DK Sivakumar cannot say Similarly, Sidhramayya He cannot say that he will do the interviews of any of the leaders of the Congress That is what Sidhramayya did But if he wants to take the team He cannot do it like Sivakumar He will do it like Devegaon's Kutumbaraj Kumarswamy Suta and all the people The character of the people The conduct of the people He will talk about it But when it comes to Sivakumar It is very difficult to defend him Sivakumar is now His power has reduced He did not do it in this period He did it in the SM Krishna period I am a ticket collector I will not ask you to give me the ticket I will do 50 surveys If I get the name in 49 of them If I get the name in one survey I will not give it If I get the name in 50 surveys If I get the nomination If I get the victory Then you give me the ticket He has taken the words of his heart with Sidhramayya He has said that see the president Do the research and come Sidhramayya says like this In the internal inquiry of the party All this seems very normal But when people know What is the reality here Because the politicians have to think Who should vote and who should not But here they are cheating me I wanted the ticket I have to give the ticket I will do MLC I will stand against someone I will not say that I cannot support them If it is corruption inquiry I can support Sidhramayya I can support DK Shukumar I have to see the president He is saying one or the other Another sport inquiry About the JDS party YSV Dutta Has spoken to Atmeer About the JDS party Because they have come from the same party So that party About the JDS party About the experience of the party About the people who were sad About the people who were happy Atmeer has spoken But that is a sport About the JDS party YSV Dutta About the sportsman About the former chief H.D. Devegode Dutta has spoken with great pride My former CM H.D. Kumar Swamy He said that he was jealous He built a bambal granary in Gadur I was the winner But Kumar Swamy did not like it Sport inquiry about the JDS party Has been made public by H.D. Devegode YSV Dutta Look, H.D. Devegode Is my relative for 50 years From the beginning Kumar Swamy Was jealous of me He was inside the party And he said that he was jealous He said that it will be bad His bambal granary in the area Is not good All these are the same Devegode and Atmeer Sat next to me in the assembly Look I am the chief in the assembly They are the leaders But they did not like me In the days of H.D. Devegode Kumar Swamy was playing the game He was playing the game He was not coming He was coming to the assembly every day He was not coming He was coming to the assembly He was telling me to attack Sidramayee I was telling him that I will not attack Sidramayee He was feeling bad He was sitting next to me in the assembly He was telling me He was not coming every day He was telling me to attack Sidramayee He was fearing But I did not do it What is the use of being jealous of someone This is politics This is about the party This is about the development If you do not like me I will give the state name to the assembly I will not attack Sidramayee I will not attack Sidramayee They were playing with ethics They were playing with ethics They were playing with ethics They were playing with ethics They were playing with ethics But the people of the assembly They won and made me the MLA They won and made me the MLA They won and made me the MLA They did not like me They did not like me H.D.Gowda was very angry H.D.Gowda was very angry Dharme Gowda and Bhoje Gowda Dharme Gowda and Bhoje Gowda They were against me They were against me I will not feel bad I will not feel bad Really They were very gentle They were very gentle During this corona time During this corona time They were a college students They were a college students They have their own agenda They have their own agenda They don't hate anyone They don't hate anyone They don't hate anyone D.K.Kumar was the next D.K.Kumar was the next They were against me They were against me They were against me They were against me I am also proud of them I am also proud of them I am also proud of them I am also proud of them I am also proud of them I am also proud of them I am also proud of them I am also proud of them I am also proud of them I am also proud of them I am also proud of them I am also proud of them I am also proud of them I am also proud of them I am also proud of them They said ""He won't listen to me"" They said ""He won't listen to me"" They said ""I was good with Chellurai Swami, Zamir"" They said ""I was good with Chellurai Swami, Zamir"" They said ""I was good with Chellurai Swami, Zamir"" They said ""I was good with Chellurai Swami, Zamir"" They were a little upset They were a little upset They were a little upset They were a little upset They were a little upset They complained to Devegaon They complained to Devegaon They complained to Devegaon They complained to Devegaon What should I do?

 Now, regarding Meesalati, DK Shivakumar and Yathnalar had a talk fight. Congress and JDS both said that ""In the last moment, the election has taken advantage of Meesalati's decisions to the state government"" ""We will come to power in another 30-40 days and we will abolish him"" We put quotes to the words ""all of them"" and asked the question ""All of which?"" Because Meesalati had made many decisions. One was Meesalati's dissemination. 3% of ST Meesalati increased to 7% 15% of SC Meesalati increased to 17% ""We will abolish all of them, but this will come"" ""No, no"" There is clarity in that matter. Because, all parties had a meeting and decided To join it to the 9th schedule A letter was sent to the state government and central government ""This and that"" It is a wrong idea If 9 schedules are joined, It will be eliminated from the state government's view I have cleared it in many instances Let's not go into that matter There is no different opinion about Meesalati's dissemination All agreed But, on the 24th, the cabinet had announced its decision What is the different opinion about that? Yes. So, what is taken back? There is a discussion. One, Lingayat and Okkaliga Meesalati Was disseminated and made into separate categories 2C and 2D categories Earlier, Okkaliga had 4% Lingayat had 6% Lingayat had 5% And now, it is 7% Will you take it back? I don't know. I am not giving any details Will you take it back? Lingayat and Okkaliga had more Meesalati No. If you say so, Lingayat and Okkaliga will keep quiet Meesalati was made into a separate category Earlier, it was 15% And now, it is 17% 17% was made into a separate category Related to the society Lingayat was made into a separate category 2 communities 2 communities which are more Infected by the disease Lingayat had 6% That is the opinion of Sada Shiva Ayog 6% Balasamudaya Balagai Samudaya had 5.5% Sada Shiva Ayog had 5% The most affected communities Bovi, Banjara Or Lambani Koracha, Koram They gave 4.5% Sada Shiva Ayog gave 3% They were given 4.5% All these people said 1% They were given 1% This is not Valameesalati Even if you use the word Valameesalati It is Valameesalati Some people used the word ""You have destroyed the Dalit community of one mother"" So, After coming back, Cancel the Vingadane And all together, Cancel the Dalit community They didn't say anything So, the left and right communities Are getting settled The only happy ones are Banjara, Koracha, Koram And Bovi communities Because Valameesalati Which is given by our people Is the demand of the left communities For many years That has been resolved They didn't say anything They said they will resolve it confidently They had given 4% to the Muslims After coming back, they will give it back About this, D.K.Shukumar and Yathnadurai will tell In the 90's They made 3 changes No one gave the commission's report No one gave the final report Without giving any report They came and said ""You have done this and that"" My brothers, My brothers, My brothers, My brothers, We are the leftists We have self-respect for this society We didn't come here to beg We didn't come here to scold The first meeting, we will scrap all this Congress government will come We will sit We will cancel all this and complete it If you are there If you are there If you are there, tell it In Karnataka, people are destroying the Congress In Karnataka, people are destroying the Congress In the politics of this state Vakkali and Lingayat are powerful If D.K.Shukumar If D.K.Shukumar has the guts to speak He will say it Vakkali will show him After Vakkali's vote His brothers' vote When it comes to the vote The whole caste will vote They will take the vote And go to the court This is the Asyanet News Network This is the Asyanet News Network The Asyanet you are watching is a Suvarna News"

 In Shikaripur, after the demolition of Edivorappa, a stone demolition project was conducted. The house was demolished and a meeting was held. In that context, the PM B.Y. Raghavendra had a discussion with him. The house was demolished by SP Mithun Kumar. The Chief Minister has created a big ruckus in the Meesilati case. The Home Minister has to return to the centre stage. We have neglected his leadership. We have gone to his house, had breakfast, and have given him a pen. We have given him all the necessary documents. We have not gone to the church. The house was demolished by the BJP. Who is responsible for this? It should not be the BJP. Edivorappa did not say. How can you say Edivorappa did not say? Edivorappa said that he did it because he was a criminal. The house was demolished by the SP. The Meesilati case is a big ruckus. The government should take the decision. I have no relation to the person who has the role in this. The BJP government has created such a situation. I am saying this to the BJP party.

If we do this, it will be good for the youngsters. If we get support. The government has promised to do something. But they have not done anything yet.

 Do you see the JDS as being a serious threat in this election or do you see this largely as a bipolar fight between the Congress and the BJP? No, I don't want to comment much on that because we have tried them, we have pressured them, we have given an opportunity. They could not deliver. They are still the tallest party for the Vokal Igga community from where you come. Fine, but their numbers will be reduced in a very big way. Whatever the seats they got in Mandya, whatever the seats they got in Mysore, whatever the seats they got in Assam will not be repeated again. When Congress MP Rahul Gandhi was in the United Kingdom, he seemed to be asking for external help. Asking countries in Europe and the United States to come help democracy in India. Now a lot of the BJP leaders are attacking RG for saying why does an Indian democratic leader want Europe and America to intervene in India's affairs. How do you see this? See, in various cases, while world leaders have come to India, it may be Bill Clinton or Obama, the other Prime Minister, President of America, Mr. Obama, while going back they said that they have to protect the secular sanctity of this country. They have given statements. In this context, he wanted to keep this country united. Without Gandhi family, Congress or the country could not be united. Congress can be, a country can be united only with the Congress' leadership. That is why a lot of people are there, better see them, because when the Prime Minister went out of the country, in America also, last time before the presidential election, he said, he gave a speech on the former President of India to support him. ""Aapki baar"" (You are the best) He has given a statement. Like that, he also feels that yes, we have to save this country. He feels that a lot of people outside the country are there, that they all join together and support us. When Vasavaraj Bhomai was made Chief Minister of Karnataka, there was a sense that Mr. Yadurappa's time and tenure was kind of over. But we saw the Prime Minister came recently, felicitated Mr. Yadurappa on his birthday, in some senses sending a message that BSY is still the face that they hope to take to the people of Karnataka because he is the tallest Lingayat leader in the state. See, we have a lot of respect for Yadurappa. But why Yadurappa has been removed? Why there is no answer? Why Yadurappa has to cry? Why Yadurappa's son could not be made even an MLC? Not even an MLC! They could not accommodate him as an MLC, they could not accommodate him as a minister. Then what is the use of making a lip sympathy? Lip sympathy doesn't work. The people of the state know that how Yadurappa has been backstabbed and they will give a result on it. You know, the Congress party has given various freebie announcements. You know, you promised 200 units of electricity, then there was a promise of 2000 rupees to every woman, then 10 kgs of rice. Now, this is raising concerns about whether you could cause financial distress to Karnataka with all these freebies, something that the Prime Minister seems to be very opposed to. I don't know whether the Prime Minister has seen his own manifesto under his leadership and the Indian leadership. See, I was a power minister. 10,000 MW of power was there, was being produced when I was a minister. Then I left the office, it was 20,000 MW of power. Transmission losses was 21%, it came to a reduce to 14%. If you stop this corruption, it is enough. How did they manifest? In the manifesto, they said that they are going to double the income of the farmers. They said that 1 lakh rupee of loan will be waived. They said that they are going to give instead of 7 hours power, free power to the farmers, 10 hours. How did they announce that? How did they, without having a proper knowledge, did they announce that? I am telling you, I was a power minister. I know we, Karnataka, have sound financial strength. We can manage. We will help it out, whatever we have committed. See, the price rise. They said that they are going to double the income of everyone. Whose income they have doubled? No income has been doubled. Achche din, where is that achche din? With their promises, we have come out all this way. But our promise, we will deliver. Mr. Shiv Kumar, you are fighting a very important battle. Because this is not just a battle for Karnataka, this is a battle to prove that the Congress still has what it takes to win against the BJP. If you win, it gives the Congress some hope. If you don't, then it basically means that the game is over, khalas for the Congress, because they can't win Karnataka, they basically just pack up and go home. You will have a surprise, you will have a change. The change for the growth of this country, the change for the unity of the country, the change for the development of this country, the change for the youth of this country. But the BJP has the one thing you don't have, which is the magic of Modi. They think that Prime Minister Modi can help overcome a lot of the anti-incumbency against the state. Even Modi was there in Himachal, he was there in Delhi, he was there in West Bengal, he was there in Tamil Nadu, he was there in Kerala, he was there in Dargah, he was there in Telangana. I don't think that will help you out. That will not help out. Well, we'll find out once the verdict is announced. The ballot is more stronger than their bullets, than their words. The ballot will prove that. Though they are trying to, you know that they wanted to, they made a big, more than 8000 officers, we are lost. They appointed their cadres. We found out they wanted to deduct the minority and should have cast vote. And we went to the election commission, election commission came out, then a lot of officers were suspended. This is the way they are trying to gain their election prospects. Okay. We'll find out when the votes are counted, whether this confidence is based on genuine reason, or whether it's a bit up in the air, but thank you very much."

 In Karnataka, a video of Congress President D.K. Shiv Kumar is going viral on social media. This viral video is being told about Tuesday. According to the news, D.K. Shiv Kumar was seen flying 500 rupee notes on people during a rally in Mandya on Tuesday. So what is the truth of this video? Let's see in the report. BJP knows how to make a mountain out of a molehill. And when it comes to winning the election, BJP adopts all the restrictions. Similarly, BJP is doing the same in Karnataka. In the state, BJP is facing a big challenge to defame Congress. BJP leaders do not want to miss any opportunity. And the same opportunity was given to them by Karnataka Congress President D.K. Shiv Kumar. But the video in which BJP is attacking them is not the whole truth. Let me tell you that D.K. Shiv Kumar was seen flying 500 rupee notes on artists near Bevina Halli in Shrirang Patna during the Congress's Prajadhwani Yatra. The video of this incident has also come out. But in this video, he only takes out money from his pocket once. And because of being on a moving car, he gives notes to artists from above. Which is now being presented by making a video of flying notes. Whereas only once D.K. Shiv Kumar does this. D.K. Shiv Kumar gave 500 rupee notes to people yesterday. After which the Karnataka CM Basavraj Bommi said that D.K. Shiv Kumar does everything and uses all kinds of power openly. Congress thinks that people of Karnataka are beggars. But the public will teach them. People are the real masters. Now, it is clear from the statement of the CM Bommi that the BJP is afraid of losing in Karnataka. That's why she is showing this small incident by increasing it. The national media of the country is also trying to turn this incident in the BJP's favor.

 CM has become a part of Congress, to create a gondola of Congress's moustache In these three statements, one is Prahlad Joshi saying that Congress is in the limelight On the other hand, CM says that he won't blame anyone See, he is talking to the people and asking them to leave it I am saying this as a party leader This is not a state, this is a gondola in the state The Supreme Court has come to give judgement against the law The two ministers have sat against it and said that they have done it in the cabinet Where is the backward class commission's report? The report that was given in December is the interim report Can anything be decided in the interim report? These should be the Constitution amendments There could be an interim resolution or another, all should be done in a proper manner They have done a gimmick for the elections and have given a small number of people What is the use of having a small number of people in this country? There is a large population in this country They asked Swamiji to give us their share and then asked Swamiji to give us the rest We did not ask for it We had given a request to Ashok Ashok had said that he will give us a resolution on the basis of 12-15% of the population They have given us 2% and given us 4% extra What extra have they given? How much is the population of our people? How much is the population of Veerashaweepur? We both have to do something special We have to give the rest of the 56% Give it to both the communities They have to give the remaining 4% to them separately Why are you doing it by taking it from them and giving it to us? We are the people of this country We are the people of this country We are the people who feed the society We are the people who feed the society Why are you troubling us? We will give them 2A Do not trouble them They are Hindus and they have their own rights 2% is not enough We do not agree to any reason Our government will come after 40 days I will scrap all that"

 D.K.Kumar has given 2% of the mace to the students and the rest to the Pajamasal. We are not ready to agree. We don't know what the JDS stand is. Tell us about the stand and what you want to do. What I want to say is that when the JDS stand was created, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar said that the mace system is needed for a reason. He gave some guidelines to the mace system and the guidelines are to be followed. It is not enough to just wear a mace for 4 days and create a environment to get married. It is not enough to create a struggle between the castes. No one should do anything that will harm the society. This is my opinion. I will say this to all the parties. You are the ones who have created this environment. Both the parties are responsible for this. Today, we are discussing about the mace system. Today, in the guidelines that we have, as I said in Mysore, in our state, in 10 districts, the situation is worse than that of Badatan. And regarding the problems of the post commissioner, the central government has given a warning. You have taken all this and if you like the Swachhacharya, who gave you the decision? Who advised you? The BJP party, the government. You should go to the elections tomorrow morning. You are making everyone happy. On one hand, I appreciate the Muslim community. Yesterday, in the Banjara society, there was a terrorist attack. I don't know who did the strike. Many people said that they will go to the court. They said that they have taken 4% reservation. If the Muslim community had written on the street, who would have controlled? The innocent are not sacrificed. Who is controlling? This is the political system of the BJP. They took 4% and gave 2% to the people. In the society, the bloodshed is done by hands. That is the main purpose. Here, the single society, the anti-social society, we should not praise them and say that we have given them a drink. They should have fought. I tell the Muslim community, from the bottom of your heart, fight for your sister's freedom. The BJP government has done a lot of corruption. I am not responsible for that. I am not responsible for the Congress officials. I am responsible for my own commitment. Today, my commitment is that every community should have the right to live in this state. Today, after 75 years of independence, what has happened to the society? How has the society been able to live? Today, in the midst of this misogyny, they have to get justice. We should make all the communities believe that. That is my commitment. That is not all. Today, they are fighting for misogyny. They are thinking that they can get government help. What kind of government help are you giving? The government has given you a part of the contract basis. The other part is that you have to fix a rate. You are not giving them work on the moustache. Who will pay you? You are the sub-inspector. You have given them a bribe of 80 lakhs. What will you do with the moustache? If you have money, they will give you work. You have to fix the moustache. The government is not stopping this. It is not just stopping this. The system of appointment is not there. We have destroyed all this. The bribery and corruption. Which KPS? Today, the two parties who are saying that they want to clean, 15 members of KPS. You are calling it KPS Kachari. What have you cleaned? They are shouting on the streets. What is the criteria for appointment? You have made the appointment like this. Will you give an appointment in KPS that is fair? I am telling you that this system should be removed from the country."

 The reservation in Karnataka is a mockery. It is an unconstitution. It is an unconstitution. They think that reservation can be distributed like their property. It is not their property. It is their right. The minorities of this soil are living, and they have their own rights. We don't want their 4% to be scrapped and given to any of the major communities. We don't want. I'm confident the Congress party will come to power of the next 45 days, we will scrap all this."

Former Minister and Gokak BJP MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi on Sunday accused Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president DK Shivakumar of blackmailing a BJP minister to join Congress with an alleged ‘sleaze CD’. Jarkihholi also said that he will not allow Congress to form the government in the upcoming Assembly elections.

 that has erupted in pole bound Karnataka this after BJP leader and former minister Ramey Jharikoli has gone on to allege that the KPCC chief D.K. Shivkumar in fact is threatening a few ministers from the BJP to join the Congress if not he will release the CDs against them. Now responding to Jharikoli's comment you in fact have the KPCC chief and I'm quoting where he's gone on to say I don't like commenting on candidates from a mental hospital. So we'll have to get more context of where this comment was made what are the allegations that are being made by the BJP but once again a political war of words that has erupted in pole bound Karnataka all of this after you had BJP leaders also a former minister Ramey Jharikoli has gone on to make some serious allegations against the KPCC chief DK Shivakumar. Now what we hearing from the BJP leader is that DK Shivakumar in fact is threatening ministers from the BJP to join the Congress. We'll have to get more details of what is this particular CD that he is talking about and what does it really have but responding to these allegations and this comment of Jharikoli you in fact have the KPCC chief who's gone on to say I don't like commenting on candidates from quote-unquote mental hospital. So we'll have to see how the BJP now reacts to these comments that are coming in from the KPCC chief as well. We'll also try and establish a connection with a colleague to really try and get better context of this story of where these comments were made what really is the backdrop and how our political reactions coming in because as we said not the first time that we are seeing a political war of words and it becomes even more important because Karnataka is a pole bound state but first let's listen in to what DK Shivakumar had to say I don't know anything about mental hospital candidates. I don't know anything about their party. I don't know anything about mental hospital candidates. We heard from the KPCC chief DK Shivakumar who in fact has responded to these allegations that have been made by the BJP and this is what DK Shivakumar has said I won't speak anything about that mental hospital candidate I don't know anything about their party I don't like commenting on candidates of mental hospital. Let's also now bring in our colleague Ritu. Ritu first give us better context of what is this allegation that is being made by the BJP and what is the CD that they're referring to. Well you see that's the former minister from the BJP Ramesh Jarkoli who is alleging that DK Shivakumar is threatening the BJP ministers to join Congress because the Congress is lacking with the mass leaders right now ahead of the assembly elections and that's the whole reason why that the ministers who have denied to not join the Congress party are being threatened by a KPCC chief allegedly that you know if they do not join Congress party then he would be releasing a series when he says the word series it is again that of a whole controversy that had erupted if you remember in in 2021 in fact when this Ramesh Jarkoli's case the in fact the sex scandal had come out into the light of there again he was forced to step down from the minister's post so since then you see both the leaders have in fact locked horns over this whole series scandal in fact because we had seen how Ramesh Jarkoli has often alleged that DK Shivakumar has in fact is the person who is behind, who is the mastermind in fact for him to come to step down from the minister's post and since then until date DK Shivakumar has also never refrained from him commenting in fact against Ramesh Jarkoli and thereafter now you see Ramesh Jarkoli saying that DK Shivakumar is just not playing the game against him but he's also playing this whole of a CD game against the other ministers as well ahead of the assembly election. Right Ritu we leave the conversation there thanks a lot for getting us those details let's also listen it to what we heard from the BGP leader"

 Sir, Siramayya has given an interview to Kasikey channel. In that, CM has come. I command, DK Shukumar is not good. He is not getting any CM. I am Prabalakant Sen. Here the government is also making a decision. Not I command, DK Shukumar is not getting any CM. I heard that. They have already started with the dress. What is the pulse? Is the pulse of MLAs the same? They are not experts. They don't know what is the gender pulse. When the Pallatamsha comes, they will know the gender pulse. If the gender is in the pamphlet, then it is not possible to become an MLA. They have not said anything new. They have not said anything new. First of all, Congress officials do not come. They are sitting here and talking. This is very clear. This is a struggle for Congress officials to become CM. They have not done anything good for the people of Karnataka. And there is no surprise to what Sidramayya says. If it happens in the interior, it will be a revolution. On one side, DK Shukumar is telling all the people. Bless me to become CM. I will become the CM. But the people who make the CM should make the MLAs. They do not have any difference in their mind."

 After announcing the new government, we have come to know about the Congress's policies and ideas. National leaders Anand Sharma, B.L. Shekhar, PM Mansoor, PM Ramesh, PM Shai Pulla, and other friends have come. The election was announced a long time ago. But the government and the state government tried to make it as bad as possible. The election commission gave them a chance to read it. But we are happy to welcome them on this auspicious day. May 10th is not just a day to pray. It is a day to fight against corruption. May 10th is a day to build a new Karnataka. A day to build a new Karnataka free of corruption. We are seeing the decision of the people of Karnataka. The two engines have failed. We are making a new engine. May 10th is a day to give a new name to the constitution. The day the Congress government comes is your future. May 10th is a day to build your future. The Congress party is coming. It is bringing progress. This is the main mantra of our Congress party."

 start with some breaking news coming in from Karnataka. Now a video has emerged showing Karnataka Congress President DK Shivakumar throwing 500 currency notes, rupees 500 currency notes on the artists near Bevinahalli in Mandya district of Karnataka during the Praja Dhwani Yatra organized by the Congress party in Sri Rangapatna. There you have those visuals, exclusive visuals on your screens right now. You can see KPCC chief DK Shivakumar there and he was there in a rally and this coming from Mandya district and he was seen throwing 500 rupees notes, currency notes there. And of course, political storm, political reactions have also started coming in on this Karnataka Congress President DK Shivakumar. Remember, Karnataka elections are just around the corner and we see the Karnataka Congress chief there. We have my colleague Prajwal live with us on the broadcast. Prajwal, Congress cash shower, it seems right ahead of elections. What more can you tell us on this and what exactly was the event? Rakshita, now we get to understand that the Praja Dhwani Yatra was conducted in Mandya yesterday and apart from which we saw the fact that DK Shivakumar was a part of this Praja Dhwani Yatra where he was campaigning for the Congress in Mandya district near Sri Rang Patna at Bevenahalli and at this point of time there were also several cultural performances which were held in large numbers as well and therefore to show the appreciation for the artist he has gone on to throw a bundle of rupees 500 notes at these artists is what we get to learn at this point of time. And when asked about this he only has gone on to state that he has gone on to appreciate art and it was not disrespect towards anyone or disrespect towards the currency as well. But then the BJP have now gone on to lash out at him stating that this is an absolute abuse of power and this is an absolute showcase of money being thrown ahead of the assembly elections in Karnataka and such things should not be done by any party leaders is what the BJP has cried out. And meanwhile the JDS whose stronghold is in Mandya have gone on to state that the Congress think that they can come to power in Karnataka by throwing money at artists and people and trying to woo them through money power but definitely they will not be successful as well because this particular video has also gone viral on social media and therefore the Congress has faced a severe backlash especially the KPCC president DK Shivkumar in this particular issue. Right, we have seen, you told us about JDS, we also have Rajiv Tendulkar of the BJP also saying that the Congress is using cash for votes."

But immediately, I will talk to the local leaders, our block officers, BJP, the leaders of the state, they will all be alerted immediately. Within 2 minutes, I will get a message from my MP, and we will be alerted immediately. The reason for this is, you all know that someone has filed a complaint against me, BJP has not been able to do it, all this is happening. What is this moral policing? I have to fix the Chief Minister and Home Minister responsibly. This is the reporter's response. He himself was in the moral policing network, why should this not be done, why should this not be done, he encouraged me. So because of this, he went and said, his father is a farmer, I will check everything, take the money, give the money, give the receipt, he will do whatever he wants, according to the law, he can do whatever he wants. He said, give 2 crores, give 2 lakhs, give 3 lakhs, he took it and went to the police station and killed him. So the government is responsible, I am not the Chief Minister of the state, they should be responsible for this, Home Minister should be given the responsibility, they are doing it on their own. So in this way, in all our election time, we are disturbing the people, this is a big problem. This is their life, what should they do with their life, the law has given them the opportunity, they will do it, they will not do anything wrong. In this situation, they are creating a mess, the Chief Ministers who are in the government, 25 lakhs, they have to give compensation, I am doing it on my own, they have to come together, if they don't come, all the officers, you tell them, you are protecting them, because you have all the photographs, of the people who have been affected, you are giving them all the compensation, you are protecting the leaders, this is clearly seen here. So come together, your colleagues, your relatives, your relatives, who have been killed, they have come to see the murder. We have to ask the investigation, we have to ask the investigation, if we have to ask, we will ask the government, we will ask them. DK Sir... DK Sir... DK Sir... [Music]"

 DK Shivkumar of the Congress party seem to have crossed all limits. This time he has openly issued a threat to an IPS officer. While interacting with the media, DK Shivkumar said that the IS officer in the state, that's the state DG and IGP, Praveen Sood was quote on quote a nalaya. Issuing an open dhamki or an open threat to that officer, DK Shivkumar says that action will be taken against him once the Congress government is in power. Let's listen in to what DK Shivkumar first of all had to say. Police officer who have protected this government. He is a BJP leader. He is a government leader. He is a government leader. Right, my colleague Aishwarya is joining us live on the broadcast. Aishwarya, this is an extremely shocking statement coming from the side of DK Shivkumar. He is issuing an open threat to the state DG and IGP. He is an IPS officer who is holding a high rank in the state of Karnataka. Not only calling him nalayak and using such words to describe, you know, sitting IPS officer but also goes on to say that we will take action after or once rather the Congress government comes to power. Well, these are clear double standards of the Congress party on one side. What we have seen in the past is Rahul Gandhi, Malik Arjun Khadge clearly stating that different institutions are being completely governed by the government and you know the BJP is governing and controlling the entire system. On the other side now what DK Shivkumar, very close aide of Rahul Gandhi clearly speaking out in open that Praveen Sood will be sacked and they will take action when they will be back in the government in Karnataka. He also went on to say that it is the ECIA that should sack him because he has finished his tenure and he is continuing even after that. Why this worship? You know, clearly he later went on to say that because he had been filing cases against the opposition party leaders in the state of Karnataka. No case have been filed against BJP and therefore the reason perhaps once we will come into the power, we will take actions against him. Now these are double standards because Rahul Gandhi, Malik Arjun Khadge and different Congress leaders during the Bharat Jodo Yatra and different platforms have stated that it is the BJP who keeps complete control over the institutions and now this time what DK Shivkumar has stated is something which is a double standard talk and which is completely contrary to what their leaders have been stating out in open. And you know it is a pattern that we have seen Digvijay Singh in the past, Kamal Nath in the past, you know several Congress leaders have said it. Absolutely, Swarnil rightly said there is a pattern from Kamal Nath to Digvijay Singh and now of course DK Shivkumar issuing an open threat to an IPS officer. The question is why is the Congress top brass silent? Will they crack down on their own?"

 Congress has issued a list of 124 candidates for the Karnataka Vidhan Sabha elections. Where the former CM Siddharth Ramaiah has got a ticket from Varanasi. Whereas Congress has another prominent leader, DK Shiv Kumar, from Kanakpura. So, the candidates will be announced on 124 seats from 224 seats from the Congress Party. The former CM Siddharth Ramaiah and DK Shiv Kumar will fight for the elections from Varanasi. So, Congress has given them a ticket from Kanakpura. Along with this, all the prominent faces of the Congress Party have been made candidates by the Congress Party. Priyank Kharge from Chitrakoot, MB Patil has got a ticket from Babaleshwar. Whereas, 124 seats from 224 seats have been announced by the Congress Party. With more information on this news, our co-hosts Nagarjun and our community have joined us. Nagarjun, 124 candidates from 224 seats are being announced by the Congress Party. What is the big deal in this? Siddharth Ramaiah's seat was announced from Kolhar. Varanasi has changed it to its old seat. And Adi, the incumbent MLA, has won the seat of Siddharth Ramaiah's son. So, Siddharth Ramaiah has been given the seat again. As you know, the candidate of the CM Siddharth Ramaiah has been announced as a Kolhar seat 2-3 months ago. Now, his constituency has been changed after the High Command intervention. Former Union Minister Muniappa, who was a minister in the UP government, has also been given a chance in the state elections. For the first time, Muniappa, who has been a member of parliament Lok Sabha for 7 times, has been given an MLA ticket. Are there any faces in this who are shocking? Whose name is not mentioned or have come up in the list? In 124 seats, 80 MLA seats were announced. And the remaining 40-50 seats were lost by a close margin. The controversy in this list is going to come in the next list. Because there are a lot of turncoats and a lot of people will be surprised. But in 124, it was almost certain that people knew that 80 MLA seats will be given to them. And the remaining 40 seats were lost by a close margin. And the new face who was working in the constituency for 5 years, has been given the probability. There are not many surprises in this list, but the big thing about Sitra Mahal is that it is of Varna seat. Thank you Nagarjun for giving the update to the audience on this news."

 Congress was decided by Gopi Srinivas, who was a Gopi Shastra. He was given a seat by D.K.Sivakumar as a representative. But, in this situation, the Bimbaligrama, which was being announced by Srinivas, was taken away by the media. D.K.Sivakumar got angry and said, ""This is not a foreign event. It will come to our home. If you want to stay here, stay here. If you want to go out, go out. D.K.Sivakumar was angry on the Bimbaligrama of Gopi Srinivas. This is not a foreign event.

 Yesterday, I have given an interview to one electronic media. I said in the interview that I am also an aspirant for the Chief Minister post. Likewise, Mr. DK Sukumar is also an aspirant for the Chief Minister post. The aim of both of us is to defeat BJP and to bring back Congress Party. And the ground reality in Karnataka is there is a wave in favor of Congress Party. BJP is going to be defeated. My statement in the interview is misinterpreted. What I said was, I am also an aspirant, DK Sukumar is an aspirant. There is nothing wrong in democracy. Whoever may be the aspirant for the highest post, if MB party is an aspirant, or Parmeshwar is an aspirant, or DK Sukumar is an aspirant, if I am an aspirant, ultimately the newly elected MLAs will have to elect the leader of the Legislature Party after the election. Not now, after the election. And ultimately, I command us to take a decision. It is what I said. I never said, I never said, I command it is not happy with DK Sukumar or MB party or anybody, any leader. Never said. And this is what I said. And in Karnataka, there is a strong anti-incumbency against BJP government. Because BJP government is a corrupt government. Karnataka never come across as a corrupt government in independent India. So this is a corrupt government and 40% commission government. And there is a misrule. There is a, they have not done anything to the poor farmers, backward communities, and women, and labor community. See, after they came to power, not on the mandate of the people, the corporation come along. So they are looting the, the financial position of the state is very, very pathetic. So the BJP is responsible for this position of the state. So that is why people have decided to throw this government out and to bring back the party, Congress party into power. That is what I said. And this is a truth. Whatever is reported in newspapers or in electronic media, it is totally false. News first, Dikshana, New Delhi."

 In the state congress, the few Dalit leaders, rulers, the recent rulers, the future rulers, have formed a new strategy. Each one of them has a pad, and everyone is signing it. For Imolca, for Sidramayya, now 97 rulers have been elected. Why? This is very important. For D.K. Shukumar, Karge is giving his son as a gift. Why? That is also very important. The only party that has won the Karnataka election, is the congress. There is hope that they will win. In this situation, who should be the next CM? In the ruling party, there was an election. In 2013, one person was elected as the ruling party leader, and that person became the CM. In 2013, there were 3 candidates for the election. Sidramayya, Malik Arjun Karge, and D.K. Shukumar. In the end, Karge should have also sent his son to Sidramayya. Otherwise, D.K. Shukumar would have to be punished. Whoever it is, whether they are a minority, a Hindu, or a Dalit, after giving such a message, Sidramayya got about 89 votes. D.K. Shukumar got 2 votes. One was Kanakpurudu and the other was his own relative. This time also, D.K. Shukumar got the same punishment. Before the election, there was a real election. If Jameer Ahmed Khan had been the CM in Hale Mysore, in Kader's Karavali, in Kalyana Karnataka, Priyank Karge, and in Kittur Karnataka, Sakshat Satish Jharkivalli would have been the CM. In Madhya Karnataka, it was Srinivas Mane. This country, before the election, before the election, these leaders of Hindu Party, gave this letter of real election to the High Command. Keeping all these elements in front, a huge talk has taken place. A huge discussion has taken place. First, for 2 and a half years, Sidramayya and after that, D.K. Shukumar's discussion has been done in BJP's office, more than Congress. Such a game of Ahinda leaders, Sidramayya was made the CM. Or, no matter how much the majority is, the number of rulers who are against Sidramayya is more. Not only that, in DCM's party, the number of Hindus who are against him is more. So, what do you think about this? Comment, like, share the video. Also, subscribe to our channel. You will get a bell icon next to it."

 What is your opinion on the TNTV statement? I have not said anything like that. Someone has written a statement. I have said that the Chief Minister who is in the democratic process is also an aspirant and so am I. That's all he has said. But I have not said anything else. It is totally false.

The Prime Minister of India has been calling for the arrival of the Ratna Ganguly. We will do everything. The state government has been doing this for the last three and a half years. One minute, one minute. Since the last three and a half years, the state has been doing this against the government of Ediwarappan and Basaraj Bombay. See, no process can be done in a day. In all the processes, the process of making it legal, the process of making it in accordance with the requirements of the law, we have done that. Sir, Narendra Modi has been in power for ten years. What has the SCST given? What has the SCST given? What has not been given? Tell me what has been given. I will tell you what has not been given. Tell me what has been given. Listen to me.

I will tell you. Tell me what Narendra Modi has not given. I will tell you. Do not delay. I will tell you. Listen to me.

They have taken 11 crore people. No one has... Listen. Listen. No one has... No one has done the work of giving them. We have given ration. People who have lost their jobs due to corona, who should not have fast, have been given 5 kgs of food every month for 80 crore people. They have done the work of saving the lives of 130 crore people in the context of corona. SCST has not come for that. It is for 130 crore people. (Laughs)"

 Hello and a very warm welcome. Thanks for tuning in to News 9 Live. Now the poll bugle has officially been sounded in Karnataka. The state goes to polls on the 10th of May. The counting and the results on the 13th of May. And so much is already happening. So many political chess pieces, you know, moving on the board in Karnataka as well. And just a day after the announcement of the polls, BJP Karnataka stalwart BS Yedirappa, former chief minister of the state, after a long hiatus, has conducted a press conference. He declared that victory is certain for the party in the elections. He has also hinted that his son, BY Vijendra, may contest against Siddharamaiah in Varuna. Meanwhile, there are enough hints of a crack in the Congress with DK Shivakumar indicating that he is opposed to Siddharamaiah contesting from two seats. This as Siddharamaiah is now eyeing the Kolar seat after being given the Varuna seat as well. Now the Congress high command is to take a final decision on Siddharamaiah's second seat. The party is likely to finalise a new list. Today, meanwhile, it's also important to note that there is no particular list that has been put out by the Bharatiya Janata Party. We are going to take a look at what all is taking shape, what the JDS has to offer at this point in time, what has BY Yedirappa said, and at the same time, what does it mean for North Karnataka that's also taking shape. But first and foremost, the rift inside the Congress party. DKS versus Siddharamaiah, it's a crucial time of the year. Take a look at what's happening nationally, and it's crucial that Congress take this particular election really seriously and consider it as the right kind of launchpad. Will the two stalwart leaders of Karnataka Congress be able to meet each other or look at each other eye to eye? Well, that's what we're trying to decode here. Joining me in the studio is my colleague Varghese Abraham. Varghese, give us a sense of how you're looking into this particular rift. Is there a rift? If there is a rift, should there be a rift given the time, given the chances, given the scenario, what Congress stands at this point in time? Well, if you ask me, if there is a rift, there is a rift not on the surface right now, which was there in the last three months, but deep down, looking at the selection of candidates, we are looking at probably a rift in which we have Siddharamaiah's candidates as well as DK Shuma's candidates, probably trying to be put in such a way that both the leaders feel that they have some kind of a hold in the legislature. So, when we look at the list being prepared, of course, there have been several issues that have been raised as to who should stand where, because it also felt that which group you belong to, whether you were in Siddharamaiah's group or you were in DK Shivkumar's group. So, one of the interesting facts that have come out is that Siddharamaiah has been trying to, in fact, contest in one more seat. Which is this one more seat? Well, it is Kolar, where he's been trying to say that he would go ahead and stand from that place. But, interestingly enough, we have seen how Siddharamaiah, in the previous elections, had lost in one of the seats, that is from Chamundeshwari seat, against JDS's G.T. Devegaonar. And won from Badami, but not by a huge margin, but had won from Badami at a small margin, he had won from there, and still has been holding his sway in Karnataka's legislature as its opposition leader. DK Shivkumar, of course, has a huge stronghold, which is Kanakapura, and Kanakapura has been voting the Congress, even in the MP elections, as well as in the legislative election, we did see that it is a Congress bastion. Now, the reason why you are looking at the probable friction that's happening over the second seat, is probably DK Shivkumar is looking at cutting down the influence of Siddharamaiah within the Congress party in the Legislative Assembly, and he's also paving the way for his ambitions as well. So, at the larger end of the bargain, he's trying to ensure that Kolar remains within the Congress fold, where he can control, and rather than giving it to Siddharamaiah. Now, Siddharamaiah's loss in Chamundeshwari from his Mysore region, now Chamundeshwari and Varna are supposed to be constituencies that are very close to each other, Varna was given to his son, Yatindra, Dr. Yatindra had contested from Varna, so it is considered to be Siddharamaiah's bastion. So, already when he's contesting from his bastion, what is the need for him to go ahead and contest from Kolar? So, this has been going on as an internal debate within the Congress as well. But, of course, we have Siddharamaiah, who has, in fact, proved to give a stable government for five years from the Congress, without having any of the problems associated with, you know, the coalitions with the JDS, where you see Congress leaders switching sides and things like that. So, he has given that kind of a stability factor. But then, you have an upcoming leader in terms of D.K. Shukumar, who's been trying to establish himself as well. Last time, he had, in fact, made this claim, saying that he has to be considered for at least the deputy chief minister-ship of the state, when he tried to save the crumbling of the JDS-Congress alliance the first time, when he stopped a lot of MLAs from switching sides. And he was at the forefront of it. There was pressure groups that were formed, and they were, in fact, none other than then interim Congress President Sonia Gandhi, who was feeling the pressure of it when she was visiting Karnataka. And she had, in fact, gone and said, ""Don't do this."" She had categorically and openly told D.K. 's supporters not to do this. And then we find that once both of J.K. and the Congress, and of course, that has been, that was clear within, and you find D.K. 's, in fact, going out in the open and saying that, ""Mind it, all these people who have gone will be coming back, and we will, in fact, ensure that we will see a flow of leaders from the BJP and J.K.'s back into the Congress board who has left us."" So, it's intriguing as well. You have seen a lot of Congress, BJP, I mean, turncoats, who had gone to the other side coming back to the Congress as well. So, clearly, D.K. Shukla might, in fact, go ahead and demand his counter-flash right. Absolutely. Basaraj Ithnal, senior journalist, also joining us on the broadcast. Basaraj, you know, help the viewers understand here. From what Varghese is talking about, these are both men of clear ambition. They both want their say in the party's power. Now, is this really petty ego issues at play? And if it is, do you think it's important they, you know, sort out their differences given Karnataka is being looked at as a very crucial election for the Congress this year? See, there is a very nuanced kind of, you know, reading here. One is that D.K. Shukla is a Congress loyalist. He had been a Congressman ever since the end of politics. Whereas, Ramayana is an important form of JDS. And then, as well, when Ramayana came, he came with a very clear ambition that he has to be made the Secretary of Karnataka for the exact reason. He had left JDS. He had left JDS because Devya Gowda could never make him a CM face at all. So, he came to Congress and that was his understanding of the problem. That was what was promised to him by the party I command. But then also, there is a lot of murmurings that were heard among the Congress, senior Congress leaders. But even then, yes, with the leadership of Sidhram Maya, they went to a polls in 2013 and they won. And he was obviously made the Chief Minister. But again, the point here is, you look at any senior Congress leader, any tall leader from any political party, they have confidence of their constituency always. They never lose confidence on their constituency, nor the constituency loses confidence in them. For example, Bangarapa. Bangarapa, till his last election, he fought for a single constituency and he won. Sometimes he lost, but predominantly he won. So is Karge, Mr. Malik Arjun Karge or Dharam Singh. These are the people who have the faith of the constituency in them. But what's happening here is, in the last elections, Sidhram Maya moves from Corona to Badami. Not exactly moves, he contests from two constituencies. Contesting from two constituencies itself means that you have no confidence in one. And you are a state leader, you are projected as this huge mass leader, but you don't have confidence in one constituency. Look at Edirappa. Edirappa doesn't contest in alternative constituency at all. So there is some, this also sends a signal of lack of confidence in the constituency and vice versa. And probably that is what D.K. Shukumar is basing his arguments on. Number one, as we all know, he is an aspirant to the top post. And why not? Every senior leader wants to be the chief minister at one point or another at that time. Now, Sidhram has his run, so Shukumar says, why not me? And wherever he goes, even in the last couple of weeks also, wherever he goes, he keeps telling the rallies, that give me one chance, give me one chance, let me be the chief minister. He keeps on sending that message. And also at another level, he is calling BJP, the people who left Congress and went to BJP, come back. And also anybody who wants to join Congress, he is openly inviting. That is the allegation of Shukumar. So essentially, Mr. Etnal, essentially, even though Sidharam Maia is the top leader that he is, it seems like D.K. Shukumar is the one who is doing all the major and heavy lifting. But if at all, for once we can keep this aside, deem it a classic case of commentary between the two stalwart leaders of the Congress party, do you think it's right for Sidharam Maia to be eyeing Kolar, that Mysuru region? What's the contest like for him over there? Sidharam Maia, by the way he is conducting his elections, his own elections, not the party elections, it comes across as if he has no confidence. Because otherwise he would not. At one point he says that people from Badami wants me to contest elections from there. At one time he says Kolar people want me there. At another time he is talking about Varuna or Shamundeshwari. So this flip flop definitely gives away his lack of confidence. A very peculiar reason that I also heard was that he wanted to shift from Badami because it wasn't as close to Bengaluru. So travel time was very long for Sidharam Maia and that's why he wanted to change. That he did not think of it when he contested there. And there was sitting MLA, Chimankatti, he is a very senior leader of Congress. He vacated seat for him. So Sidharam Maia did not know the distance between Badami and Bengaluru then. So these are all films reasons. Absolutely. Would you like to echo on what Mr. Etnal here is talking about? Well what he raised, of course Mr. Etnal, I agree with the fact that when you give messages saying that you will contest from Badami, you will contest from Kolar or you will contest from Varuna, you are not giving that exact message saying that you are confident of winning a particular constituency. But Varuna has been a constituency where you have a history of Sidharam Maia contesting from, in fact Yatindra stood in that constituency in the previous election. So why still go for a second seat is what a lot of Congress insiders are asking. If Varuna is for sure, then why ask for Kolar? Why do you think that this could, I mean why would you think that Sidharam Maia would be asking for Kolar again? Especially when he has, Varuna has a strong seat. Is it because probably he is also looking to ensure that his son's political career is not jeopardised as well? Could be, could be that's number one. Number two, more importantly what I see is Sidharam Maia at the corner of his mind might be harbouring fears that the aspirants, the aspiring forces in Congress itself might work against him. Because there are these kind of allegations levelled on Sidharam Maia himself when it was said that he engineered the defeat of Parameshwar. You know, so that might be playing at the back of his mind because not only opposition parties, some elements within his own party might not want him to come back to assembly. That may be playing behind all this. Well, that is an interesting aspect of it that he has raised that your own team mates might use you for the entire election process as well but not want you in the assembly when the final picture arrives, Kabir. Absolutely. Well, meanwhile, Mr. Etnal, do stay on with us because there's another interesting thing that has happened today. BSAD Rappa in that press conference has hinted that his son, BY Vijendra might be contesting from Varuna against Sidharam Maia. So, essentially Vargi is more than just a battle at play here as well. We'll quickly take a look at those reactions coming from what exactly the former Chief Minister Akarnataka had to say this morning.

 We are friends with the belief that if the BJP government comes here, it will be the same in Delhi and will be acceptable to the people of the country. We are the ones who named it as double engine. But we all thought that it would be a big change in a big scale. But our dreams and aspirations have been shattered. We are the reason for the creation of a historical corrupt government. Vishwanath said that he will take the money and go. He said this to our district and to the people of Chasukara in the Vidhan Sabha. He said that if he had taken the money, he would have given it to us to build the Chamundi hill. It has been half a day since the Chamundi hill was built and no one has come. The situation is such. Vishwanath said that he will take the money and go. At that time, when the three people from Delhi's Arun Singh's party came to the concert, I told the head of the party, Mr. Edivirap, that you are a great leader. Please give us the kingdom. I told him that and I requested him. If we have any expectations, then that power or intention can be replaced. That moral guts I have. So we all are walking in accordance with our self-evidence. Whatever the government may be, whether it is the government or the wrong government, I have always done the work of educating and warning them. So when I see a mistake, I say it with full conviction. It is my right from my past life. It is not possible for anyone to take that right. And it is not possible for anyone to break my back. So, my friend, in a way, I have come to live the life of the people of Karnataka as a witness. Today, I too, for some reason, I have understood that the reason for this corrupt government to be thrown away, I have been telling my soul from the beginning. Hey Vishwanath, why did you do such a job? My inner soul is my conscience. So to stop this sin, Mahatma Gandhi has given a solution to the country. This is Delhi."

 Well, the first reaction coming right after the Election Commission's press conference. In fact, we have seen how the Congress has been predicting at least 150 is what your prediction you're looking at. While you have poll templates used by the BJP where they're saying that, you know, the JDS and the Congress using family dynasty politics, you have the Congress using the poll template in terms of the 40% corruption. Do you think any of these poll templates will be decided by the people as the mandate? The people will definitely decide on this. They want a new government. They want a change. They want a government with a governance. They want to root out corruption. They want a global Karnataka. They want a better Bangalore. This is what people are looking at. I think four years of double engine government has failed. There will be a new engine which found which will take for the prosperity of Karnataka. You know, earlier elections, we used to see your poll templates used to be on development, but today's poll templates are on communal lines. Is that what it has come to? It is the BJP agenda. BJP is on the communal agenda. We are for the progress and prosperity and the development agenda. We are for development. That is why we have given, Congress party has given four guarantees to see that the price rise is going to the sky. The income is on the bottom. Everyday pickpocket is going on. Everyday common man has been insulted. Common man has not got any benefit from this double engine government. Whatever they had promised, they have failed. That is why Congress party has given them four guarantees which will see that all of their houses will be saved. Okay. You know, the election commission did go on to say how they're going to keep a strict vigil on muscle power, the money power. We have been seeing over the past few weeks how, whether that's BJP or the Congress for that matter, you have been deploying, you know, in terms of freebies, whether cookers, saris. And yesterday, of course, we saw you as well flinging notes. See all this muscle power, money power is with all the BJP double engine government. You know how they use the muscle, how the planes will be laid, how money was being floated. MLA came out on record that he has been offered 30 crores in the assembly. This is all the official document which has been there. You see on the corruption charges, what was being seen, our BJP MLA, a local about 8 crores has been seized on corruption money. You see that all these things are a part of their structure, BJP's structure. I think whatever the freebies which we are giving, that is a full promise. That is a promise which we have made is not the BJP promise. Let me discuss, let me debate. Isn't that the agenda that we're seeing already? Yes. Let them come out with whatever the manifesto, let us discuss their manifesto with that. The Prime Minister has not forgotten what the manifesto has been given by the earlier government. They have completely failed. 600 promises have been given. Only 50 have been fulfilled. 550 has not been done. We doesn't do like that. Whatever is speak, we deliver it. That is our history. That is our creation. That is the strength of the Congress party. What we speak, we do it. Any pre-poll discussions that you have had with, always you know when you have a hung assembly with the JDS, because when I spoke to Mr. Kumaraswamy, gave him a situation like if there is going to be a hung assembly, what is the discussion right now? At what stage is it? Is it BJP or Congress? However, he did not name Congress. Instead he went on to talk about BJP is not really in a good shape in terms of communal line politics. But he did of course in a way hint at Congress. Is that something on the discussion? We do not want any alliance with any political party. If you don't get a majority at all. I am very confident we will have the two-third majority. What the BJP number will have, we will have the double number. That is my strength, my gut feeling, that is the people of this Karnataka have shown love to me, love to the state. They want a change for a better Karnataka and it will happen. How confident of your candidates that there won't be any defections? This all we have looked into in the very detail. We have scanned, we have examined, we have excreted, we have done everything. They all are the loyal congressmen. They will stand like a rock. One final question. Siddharth Ramey of course he did say that you know hinting at Kolar. Kolar is also you know concentrated in terms of Ahinda votes. That is something which as far as Siddharth Ramey is concerned. Will that eventually be decided? No, it is the Central Election Committee will decide. He had opted for a ticket. He had paid 2000 rupees to me as an application fees. He said that whatever the High Command will decide. High Command has after consulting it has given him Varna. Today he has gone for a campaigning in Varna. I wish him all the best. Karnataka will have a very prosperous new government with the collective leadership. Well, thank you. That was Mr. D.K. Shivkumar. In fact, speaking to NDTV, talking about how confident. Of course, there is not going to be any more defections as well and that the Congress will definitely come to power in the state of Karnataka. With Kumar Shrija for NDTV."

 What has the BJP leader done to the opposition party, which has been elected by the BJP against the KBCC leader D.K.S.Kumar? If Appaji Gowdru is with us, let us talk to him. Sir, do you know who Appaji Gowdru is to the people of Kanakpura? I was a candidate for the Lokaliga Sangam. I have been elected for the Lokaliga Sangam since the Kanakpura election. I am very proud of Kanakpura. My mother's place is Basuvanalli, Kanakpura Taluk. My father's relatives are there. I have been working as a head constable for the people of Kanakpura for the last 40 years. I have also served the people of Kanakpura. I have also served the people of Kanakpura. Do you know who the opposition party is? I know them well. Why do you think you can win the elections? The people have decided this. The people are not the same every time. The people of Kanakpura have decided to change the situation. Appaji Gowdru is being manipulated by the BJP. The BJP has been manipulating the opposition party.

 In the elections, you have made it very important to cut Siddaramayya. We cannot cut anyone. We have to cut the people. Who has the power to win or lose? The leader has the power. We have to stop the people who run. We have not gone to the constituency. We have gone to nominate. If you have the power, you can do anything. If you have the power, you can do anything. In the next 23 years, BJP will be very important. Did you say that? He said that. I don't know. I don't know where I am. I don't think I am important in the next 24 years. What did he say to you? He said that you are opposing Vijendra Rao. We cannot think of anyone as our opponent. We are going to ask for people's blessings. People should be blessed. It is not relevant to have someone in front of you. People have been blessed. If there is anyone in the constituency, it is possible to oppose them. That is what I am thinking. [Music]"

 Karnataka election is the biggest challenge for BJP. We say this because the party that once ruled the country, today the leaders of that party are jumping from their own ship and joining the Congress. It is a matter of concern for BJP because this time BJP is proving unsuccessful in convincing its own people. In this, another face has left the party, who was a MLA six times. Who is he and how is the party going backwards from this? See in the report. The rift in the elections of the Vidhan Sabha has been saved in Karnataka. Voting will be concluded on May 10 and the result will be on May 13. As the elections are coming closer, BJP is also getting shocks in Karnataka. Which is not a good sign for BJP. Karnataka's election survey is giving shocks to BJP. But leaving BJP's MLA and MLC party, they are increasing the tension of BJP. If we listen to Congress President DK Shukumar, many JDS and BJP leaders are in touch with Congress, who want to support the hand. In this, NY Gopal Krishna, who was a MLA six times, has joined the Congress party. It can also be said that he has returned home. Six-time MLA Gopal Krishna was in Congress earlier. After joining BJP, he became a MLA by chance. DK Shukumar made him a member of the party. Shukumar said, ""Many leaders of BJP and JDS are knocking on our door. This is proof that the voice of the state's people is on the Congress side. And our path is in the right direction towards power."" Gopal Krishna resigned from BJP's post and has now joined Congress. Similarly, JDS MLA K M Shivlinge Gora has also resigned. And he will soon join Congress. It is being said that many MLA's are angry about the ticket distribution for BJP. Four-time MLC Puttanna had left BJP and held the hand of Congress. Two former MLA's have also returned to Congress. It is believed that gradually, seeing the strength of all Congress, they are coming back to the party. which can prove to be a red alert for the BJP"

 In the past, there were 6-7 castes. Congress and the people's party were the first to reach 101 castes. But the Indian people's party did not even include a single caste. Instead, they have raised the moustache, given the left moustache and are now doing the work of giving justice to everyone. Now, Siddharma could have done it earlier. He was there for 6 years. DK Shukumar was there. He said that he will do it. Today, he has changed his attitude and said that he has done it. Now, the people will answer him in the next election. I am here to say this. There are many things that we have said earlier. Today, Congress has brought up some people. They have brought up some people who were in Congress. They have brought up some people who were in the house of Ediurappa. Not everyone came to the streets. They have brought up some people from a community. Some people have no doubt that they have done it. They know it. But all the elite castes are happy today. No one has done it. But those who have done it, they did it for a day or two. After that, everyone has become so. They too have no injustice. The people of Lambani who were there, they have come and pressed a press conference. They have said that no one has decided. They have said that they have done it. They have said that they will ask for forgiveness. Yesterday, they have also done a protest in Bangalore. The Dalit community has understood what your policy is. The people have also understood what the policy of the Indian people is. That is why, young people, this community has got justice today. No one has been injured for any reason. But some of us had a doubt. Because they had heard that the elite castes are being taken away from the Mislati community. That falsehood was spread by the Congress. That is why some people were opposing. Now even those who oppose have been given justice. 6% to the Madhya Samudaya, 5% to the right wing, and 3% to the left wing. We should thank the Chief Ministers. The Mislati community which had 15% also increased to 17%. We should understand this. For many years, the Congress and the people's party had been ruling this state. The Congress and the people's party had increased the number of castes from 6 to 7 to 101. But the Indian people's party has not even included one caste. Instead, they have increased the number of Mislati and given the right to justice to everyone. Now, Sidramayee could have done this earlier. He was there for 6 years. D.K. Shukumar was there. He said that he will do it. But today, he has changed his attitude and has come to the point that he has taken it. Now, the people will answer him in the next election. I am here to say this. There are many issues. We have said this earlier. Today, some Congress people have brought up some people. They have brought up some people who are in Congress. They have brought up some people who have brought up some people who are in Congress. They have done it. They know it. But all the oppressed castes are happy today."

 A few Hindu Dalit leaders are opposing Siddaramayya, the only leader of Karnataka. They are making NDTV a weapon. This is one of the questions. The Prime Minister Modi's TV is telling a lot of lies. It has been said. The question that Siddaramayya's fans are asking is, to the Karnataka media and the national media, do you have the guts to make Siddaramayya the king of Karnataka? Because, NDTV has not only been a source of entertainment, many national media outlets have also been making Siddaramayya the king of Karnataka. Only once in the history of Karnataka, be it NDTV or News IT, many media outlets have been making Siddaramayya the king of Karnataka. Only for this election, Siddaramayya was the king. In this situation, we need to bring three things to light. The biggest propaganda against Siddaramayya, the Karnataka media has also been doing it in a way that it is against NDTV. What has happened? NDTV has said that Siddaramayya has said that even if DK Shivkumar becomes CM, he cannot give a high command. Whoever sees the news, even if they have studied English till 5th standard, they will understand clearly. They will clearly hear it. Siddaramayya has not said that he cannot make DK Shivkumar the CM. Instead, he has said that he has appointed a CM. He has said that he will appoint a CM after the election is done. But, the media outlets of Karnataka, be it No.1 Channel, TV9, Public TV, Suvana, Magadha, etc. have repeatedly said that Siddaramayya has said that he cannot make DK Shivkumar the CM. This is a big lie. The TV which has been made clean, the TV which has been shared a lot, Adani's NDTV, be it BJP's Shuddu or Pradhani Modi's Shuddu, Siddaramayya has said that it has been made clean. This is not the first time. It has happened many times. Because, Siddaramayya has said that he will appoint a CM after the election is done. He has said that he will appoint a CM after the election is done. It is true that all the KPCC's legal cells are capable of going to Ganesh Ketha. Because, when Siddaramayya was rejected many times, the people of KPCC's legal cell were drinking tea, coffee, and smoking. This is a proof that the people of Ganesh Ketha are in the legal cell. If a state media is doing such a propaganda, if you can't even give a notice, why do you need a legal cell of the Congress? To make it a notch, Siddaramayya's fans are tweeting and expressing their anger. This is the third thing. Everyone is asking, if you have the guts, if you have the power, don't send photos of Siddaramayya, don't send his name, don't make his Shuddu, you have banned Darshan, let's see if you can ban him. This is the question that is being asked. They can't do it. Because, for the sake of state politics, I have also been a journalist for 10 to 12 years. I have worked in many media organizations. I know how much TRP Siddaramayya gets for one media outlet. I know how much TRP he gets for the other mass leaders. I know the person who worked as a program producer. If you have the guts to even show that work on TV, prove it and if you have the guts, we can take Siddaramayya's story. It is impossible. They can't do that. Instead, they do propaganda. Even there, they can take TRP. This is also true. It is not wrong to listen to Siddaramayya's pride. If you have the guts, don't send photos of Siddaramayya, don't make his Shuddu. This is a question that can be asked by the Kannada media or the state media. Will you accept? You can ask the state media, why do you need Siddaramayya's Shuddu? For this, you can search on Google or YouTube and see that the state media has only introduced it to Siddaramayya. If needed, it could have been introduced to others. It could have been introduced to Kumar Swamy, it could have been introduced to Ediurappa, it could have been introduced to Bhosevaraj Bommai. But in the context of the election, they have only used Siddaramayya. Now they have changed it. This NDTV, Modi's extreme TV, is nothing but a lie. For such a propaganda, what is the value you give? What is the comment you give? Comment, like the video, share it. If not, subscribe to our channel. You can see all the links on the side."

 Welcome back, Swami ji was called to the court and asked to accept the Meesalati case. Shiv Kumar has accused him of this. Jayam Ruthinjaya Swamy ji has given a statement. Jayam Ruthinjaya Swamy ji has given a statement. No one has called us to accept the case. It is wrong to say that we will not accept the Meesalati case. Congress officials have said that justice should be served. It is not right to give such statements. Jayam Ruthinjaya Swamy ji has said that the government has found justice for the current situation. Whoever asks you to give a 4% discount, you should begging for it. We are not beggars. We will not call and beg. You should accept and do good for us. We are not here to beg. We will not call and beg. You should accept and do good for us. We are not here to beg. We are here to tell the truth. The government officials have given them the opportunity to speak. They are not telling us that it is wrong to say this. So, the people of Lingayat should not say that. You should give justice to your party. All parties should be equal. We should not say that we will not accept the case. We should tell them that we will not give justice."

 We have brought some of the high voltage areas in Karnataka's 824th committee meeting This is D.K. Shivkumar's Kanakapura area This is a high voltage area because of the high competition, competition and competition But because of the recent and the recent Chief Minister's election, you might have got an idea It might have been either Bommai or Siddaramayya It might have been HD Kumar Swamy or D.K. Shivkumar This is D.K. Shivkumar's Kanakapura area Since 1989, he has won 7 times continuously He has won 7 times and entered the committee He has become the KPCC President D.K. Shivkumar has been working for the Kshetra for so many years He has been standing in the Kshetra continuously Kanakapura means D.K. Shivkumar and D.K. Shivkumar means Kanakapura There is no other way out There are no opposition here This is the district where Ramnagar has the hold of JDS Even though Ramnagar is a district, JDS has some percentage of votes here D.K. Shivkumar might win more votes than the state this time He has already won 68,000 votes He might win more than 1 lakh votes this time Because the CM candidate is usually more popular There is a calculation that Kanakapura's Bande might become the CM this time Who knows who will get the power Who will win the 113 seats Who will cross the magic number JDS is now 123 BJP is now 140 Congress is now 130 We are now at 140 Who will get the seats? Who knows? But in Kanakapura, D.K. Shivkumar has won D.K. Shivkumar is the best in Kanakapura He has inaugurated the hospital so well He has given the hospital's barbosan He has warned the people of Kanakapura that the government should not reduce the facilities D.K. Shivkumar is a man who can do anything in a cool way But this time he has decided to become the CM He has asked the people of Kanakapura to give him a chance He has asked the people of Kanakapura to give him a chance Kanakapura will win BJP, Karakpura's President Jagannath, JDS, Bal Narsimha, Chikkappa can all stand But none of them will contest and fight for D.K. Shivkumar Kanakapura is a place where only D.K. Shivkumar can stand and win Till then, we don't know how much time he will have D.K. Shivkumar has won 7 times in Kanakapura He may win 8 times but it is not surprising This is the amazing work of Kanakapura The drinking water system is still a basic facility The road to Meke Datu or Kadane Havali He has made a big step to Meke Datu He has called the National leaders The campaign to prepare for the Congress has started from Kanakapura Kadane Havali is more in this area The road to Bangalore is a basic facility D.K. Shivkumar has solved many such problems Government construction, drinking water, rural water, etc. D.K. Shivkumar can also help in the water supply D.K. Shivkumar has helped his team in the water supply D.K. Shivkumar has given 700 to the experts D.K. Shivkumar has given 700 to the Chief Minister D.K. Shivkumar will win in Kanakapura D.K. Shivkumar is the only one who can win in any field Sidhramaiah can win if he goes to any field Bombay can win if he goes to any field D.K. Shivkumar is like H.D. Kumar Swamy D.K. Shivkumar is the one who can win even if he goes to any field D.K. Shivkumar will win this time This is the high voltage field of Kanakapura We are here to see the Chief Minister's water supply But we request you to be alert Give your vote to the people who are not alert Don't vote for the people who wear 5000, 2000, women, clothes, etc. This is the high voltage field of Kanakapura"

 Hare Krishna, friends, welcome to my channel. Whose government will be formed in Karnataka? Will the Indian People's Party come back there or will it be the Congress government? Many viewers have asked and they wanted to know what the birth chart of DK Shiv Kumar, the head of the Congress Party, says. In this video, we will discuss what will be the results of the planets, which phase, what will be the result of the birth chart of DK Shiv Kumar, the president of the Congress Party. Because the entire responsibility of the Congress Party is on DK Shiv Kumar. We had discussed this before in the video, we got a lot of good responses from the audience, comments came, and keeping this in mind, keeping your enthusiasm in mind, we decided to discuss the birth chart of DK Shiv Kumar. Because the election of Karnataka in the country is being looked at in a lot of meanings. Rahul Gandhi, who was from Wayanad and now his membership has been questioned, that is a different topic. But will this also have an effect on the Karnataka election or not? First of all, let's talk about Congress President DK Shiv Kumar of Karnataka. He was born on May 15, 1961 at 5 o'clock, 15 minutes, Kanakhali, Karnataka. If we talk about his birth chart, then the mesh is his lagna. And if we talk about the placement of the planets, then the first house is empty. In the second house, there is Sun, Moon and Mercury. His third house is empty. His Mars is in the fourth house. His Rahu is in the fifth house. His sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth house is empty. In the tenth house, there is Jupiter and Saturn. In the eleventh house, there is Ketu and in the twelfth house, there is Venus. Friends, as we all know, according to The Hindu, the discussion I will do here, there will be elections for 224 seats, which the Election Commission has announced. The election will be voting on May 10 and the counting will be on May 13. Based on this, the birth chart of DK Shiv Kumar Ji is currently running in the Mahadasha of Saturn and the Antardasha of Venus, which started on November 4, 2021 and will continue till January 4, 2025. That is, the Antardasha of Venus and the Mahadasha of Saturn. If we talk about this birth chart, then the position of Saturn is very good. He is sitting in the tenth house and is sitting in the Capricorn sign. And there is the Antardasha of Venus. In this birth chart, Venus is sitting in the twelfth house, that is, it is sitting in the Pisces sign. So, if we talk about the Mahadasha and Antardasha on the basis of the birth chart, then the birth chart of DK Shiv Kumar Ji is a very strong birth chart. If we talk about the very important role that is going to play in the Antardasha, then Saturn will be in the tenth house of the Capricorn sign. So, this additional benefit is given to Shiv Kumar Ji. If we talk about the position of planets in the birth chart, in the Antardasha and in the Capricorn, all three together, we see that the birth chart of DK Shiv Kumar Ji is very good. And you will see that DK Shiv Kumar Ji is going to give a very tough fight to the Indian People's Party in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly elections. And at this time, the Congress and the Indian People's Party have been in a kind of election war in the whole country. Because this election will not only affect Karnataka, but will also have a very big impact on the elections in 2024, which are to be held in the Lok Sabha. And as I do every political prediction on the basis of birth chart, I tell you in advance that this Indian People's Party or Congress Party, both of which, I will say that the leadership also depends on their basis. That is, if we are looking at the birth chart of DK Shiv Kumar Ji, then we will have to pay attention to three factors. First of all, the top leaders of the Congress Party, Sonia Gandhi Ji, then Rahul Gandhi Ji and Priyanka Gandhi Ji. After that, the number that will come will be of DK Shiv Kumar Ji. And then, on the basis of the birth chart of all these, we decide that how the party's situation is formed. So, in this video, I have only discussed the birth chart of DK Shiv Kumar Ji. We have discussed Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi in other videos. You can go and watch those videos there. Overall, at this time, the birth chart of DK Shiv Kumar Ji is very good. I have made a lot of predictions about Rahul Gandhi Ji, which have come true. We have also made a separate video for them. So, in total, at this time, DK Shiv Kumar Ji is going to face a very tough time. But because the Congress Party is in a very weak position right now, I think that the chances of becoming a government in Karnataka are very low. But DK Shiv Kumar is going to come to Karnataka as a very strong leader. I also think that after the Karnataka election, Rahul Gandhi Ji can give him a big responsibility at the national level. Because this kind of birth chart of DK Shiv Kumar Ji is made at the national level. And my advice to both DK Shiv Kumar Ji and Rahul Gandhi Ji is that DK Shiv Kumar Ji should be brought to the national level. So that the Congress Party can get maximum benefits. Friends, we have discussed the birth chart of Basha Rao Ji of the Indian People's Party. Here we have discussed about DK Shiv Kumar Ji. And the third party, which is considered to be a big party, or I would say that it is not in power, it is considered to be a JDS. We are going to make a separate video about it. Friends, if you like this video of ours, you will get a lot of videos on the channel at the political level. We have made predictions about them. You can go and see them there. So if you are in politics or you are interested in politics, then send us your birth chart. And we will tell you whether you will be successful in politics or not. If you are successful, then which party will you be from and at what time? Friends, that's all for today. I will meet you again with a new topic. Till then, Hare Krishna."

 it continues to watch. The entire Punjab police is looking right now for Amrit Pal but they cannot manage to find him, the man instead putting out this video on the social media. On a two day dharna, Mamata Banerjee is challenging the BJP, she says, ""Will not be afraid, the BJP can just not scare me."" A very good evening and thank you for staying with us on Republic, the show is called The Burning Question and I am Deeti Sachdeva. As always we are asking questions that matter. As always we are asking questions that make you realize today that there are elected state governments who are willing to surrender before a man called Amrit Pal. Amrit Pal remember continues to portray himself as a martyr, some say as a hero but the big question is what has the state said, what has the state done so far? Has Amrit Pal been arrested? The answer is no. Has Amrit Pal decided to surrender? There are remember indications that he possibly would want to surrender, he would want to orchestrate circumstances and come out like a martyr or will Amrit Pal again escape like he has been on the run for the last many, many, many days. Whenever you've asked the question of the Punjab government remember they want to go quiet, they say we are trying, we are a new government, give us time but the question is ladies and gentlemen that has the state totally capitulated before a man called Amrit Pal? There is a police force of 80,000 plus men in uniform, once considered to be the bravest police force in the country. If that police force wants can they not arrest the man called Amrit Pal? And the man is cocking a snook at the system because he decides to resurface today again on the social media where he's put out a video, he's again provoking, he's again daring the state. The chief minister who also doubles up as the home minister is quiet, the central agencies till now have not responded as to where really is Amrit Pal and we want to know whether Amrit Pal will even be arrested ever or all that you'll see of him are only CCTV images. Let's bring up the entire story, all the action that Republic and the entire team has reported and the last seen location of this man called Amrit Pal and then we debate. 80,000 members strong police and security force hunt for Amrit Pal and then this video from fugitive Amrit Pal himself. The video comes after reports that Amrit Pal may surrender to the Punjab police after 10 days of being on the run. But what's shocking in this video is this, firstly Amrit Pal takes a dig at the police, mocking them almost. Secondly, the war is Punjab day chief remains brazen, saying that he's safe, assuring his supporters of continuing the fight and moreover asking for mobilization. The developments come in as the Amritsar police issue posters of Amrit Pal, declaring him wanted. Five minute long video of Amrit Pal Singh is a state of a challenge to Punjab police in which all the tall claims that has been fallen flat after the video of Amrit Pal Singh has been surfaced in which he has stated that if police wanted to arrest him, it could have been done from his native village itself. And even he has addressed the people also and saying that he's all fit and fine and have not arrested by Punjab police. And even in that video, he has also given a message to Akal Takht Jathedar to organize an event Sarbat Khalsa on the eve of Bisaki itself. Amrit Pal's video as he evades the police, raising some burning questions. Who's letting him escape? So how is it today that time and again you have Amrit Pal who's caulking a snook at the system. First, remember, it was what happened in Ajnala, followed by this particular video. And in the middle of all this, the last many, many days, we've been given multiple inputs that this man has possibly fled Punjab. He was sometime, remember, spotted in Haryana, then in Delhi. Then there were reports he possibly could have fled to Nepal, but he's right under their nose. He's right under the nose of Bhagwan Singh Maan, possibly in the state of Punjab. And how is it today that the state has no clue or the state possibly is not even interested in arresting him? Let's say good evening to Dr. Vikram Singh, who's a former DGP of the state of Uttar Pradesh with us on the show, along with Prabalochan Singh, who's a human rights activist. I also do see Harish Rai Dhandaji. He's the spokesperson of the Shiromani Akali Dal with us. Lokesh Jindal is leader of the Congress Party. And I want to take our first question to Ravi Srivastava, who's a political analyst, but he leans towards the 'up'. Ravi, where is Amritpal? What's happening? Why is Bhagwan Singh Maan not even interested in arresting him? What's going on? DGP, I think law will take its own course. It is not that he can escape forever. The fact is that he has been completely neutralized. In the last 12 days, all his accomplices, all his supporters, yeah, he's all have been caught, all have been arrested. His arms have been taken away. His vehicles have been seized. And those people have been shifted to Assam. So he has got no support there now. It is only he's trying to create an optics that I am still, that, you know, he has given up his BANA. I don't know. I suspect this video also seems to be kind of a, you know, doctored one or edited one because he's seen in a different attire on the road. And when he's making the video, it's all together a different kind of a get up. So there is some suspicion. But one fact I am assuming that somewhere somebody in the police force or in the government is hand in glove with Amrit Pal. That is for sure. Because 80,000 police force. That is Ravi Srivastava such a big admission on the top of the debate. And it's not me saying this. It's not even me saying it, not even any opposition party saying this Vikram Singh sir. But this is Ravi Srivastava who actually bats for the Aam Aadmi Party again and again. And today Ravi is saying that someone in the government or someone perhaps in the police department is in cahoots with Amrit Pal. The reason why he understands and he gets to know of the entire move of the Punjab police. But Ravi Srivastava then, why is Bhagwan Singh Manth still the chief minister of Punjab? He should resign. If he's not able to crack down on Amrit Pal, that man continues to be a fugitive. You know what happened in Anchanala. For the last many days, all that we've been seeing Ravi are only CCTV footages of this man. No, you have to give him marks for this that there has been no bloodshed, not a drop of the blood falling on the floor, not even a single bullet was fired. Entire Punjab is peaceful. There is no tension at all. You have to give marks to Bhagwan Singh Manth. What I'm saying is that there are always people he has already taken tasks. Eight officers have been action has been taken. The Honorable High Court made an observation that how come in presence of 80,000 police force he could escape. Manth has taken action against those officers as well. Who's the Home Minister? Ravi, Ravi, Ravi, just help me remember. Perhaps I'm forgetting. Yes, the High Court had those words. The High Court asked that what are 80,000 plus, you know, policemen doing if they cannot catch Amrit Pal? Tell me who's the Home Minister of the state of Punjab? Bhagwan Singh Manth himself. I'm not denying your question. What I'm saying is that Bhagwan Singh Manth did take action against the police officers for their negligence of duty. Then if he's not in charge, all of that man has no control of what his police force is doing. He should resign. Vikram Singh sir, shouldn't he resign? It's very easy to play this ping pong, no? The state versus the center, the police versus the Home Minister. But Vikram Singh sir, where does the red line draw here? You're very right, Deepti ji. The responsibility lies at the table of Mr. Bhagwan Manth, who's the Chief Minister and the Home Minister. Mr. Ravi Srivastava is a very esteemed panelist and he has made a very forthright and a straightforward remark that somebody in the police and the government is complicit with Amrit Pal Singh. And Amrit Pal, make no mistake about it, is being funded by Sikhs for justice. Waris Punjab is being funded by anti-national elements. And what happened in Ajnala was absolutely a surrender. What happened thereafter was an absolute disaster, unmitigated disaster at that. That 80,000, the High Court was unswerving and said 80,000 policemen could not account for Amrit Pal. Then the statement, the bond homie and the fondness for Amrit Pal. Hamare ladke hain, ham dekh lenge. This is not the way government is run. Hamare ladko ne bahut badi battameezi ki, they transgressed the rule of law and were in fact at fault of attacking policemen, attacking the police station, ransacking the police station and almost got away with murder. Now he was a fugitive. Everybody got his video footages, but maybe after 12 hours or 24 hours. I would have been very happy if your informers gave you a footage that was almost about 60 minutes old so that you could be in hot pursuit and accounted for it. But that was not to be. I do hope, I really don't know why the compulsion, you did not declare a reward of rupees one crore on him because had there been a reward of one crore on him, his own associates would have got after him and would have handed over to the police. Now to say what Mr. Ravi Shrivastava said, there is a lot of merit in what he has said. Unless there is complicity from inside or some signal, howsoever vague it may be, to let him go hunt with the hound and run with the fox. Under these circumstances, Amrit Pal got an escape route and the rest is history. So why you alarmed him? Ravi, you must respond to that question that Vikram Singh raises. He's a former DGP of the state of Uttar Pradesh. You know, it's not that you can put all the onus just on the police and just have some routine transfers and believe everything is good and fine because you know people are watching this. Even in Ajnala, you wanted this entire story to play out and you're doing the same again. Why is your police not able to actually apprehend this man? Or you want him to surrender, you know, create a whole drama, make him a hero? No, you are repeating the question. The fact is that Vikram Singh is a very decorated officer. Because you are not answering that question Ravi. That's the only question that matters. That how is it that for the last 10 plus days, you have not been able to arrest Amrit Pal? What I am saying is everything will be analysed. It is not that alone that Punjab police only is at fault. He had been moving in Lakhimpur, Kheri also. He had been moving in Delhi also. He had been moving in Uttarakhand also. All the police should be together. The other thing is what the central agencies are doing, what the NSA has got there. Because today you are in government. Today you are in government. Exactly. This is what happens when you are in government and you are asked such questions. Let me open this up. Let me open this up. Harish Rai Dhanda, Lokesh Jindal, Ravi, Ravi, Ravi, I think the Aam Aadmi Party today should be ashamed. They should be ashamed of themselves. A Bhagwan Singh Maan, an Arvind Kejriwal today, who otherwise give themselves a pat on the back for almost anything and everything today, are absolutely quiet on Amritpal. Why are they quiet? If Bhagwan Maan is not able to control the state of Punjab, he should resign. No, sorry. When will it be done? How much time? How much time, Lokesh Jindal? Lokesh Jindal, do you believe that the Aam Aadmi Party here is at fault? Yes, certainly. Certainly, Aam Aadmi Party is at fault. But the larger question is, why hasn't Amritpal Singh yet been given the title of a terrorist and NIA has been active against him? National Investigating Agency is a central agency that deals with counter-terrorism. And if NIA, now NIA has the authority so as to conduct interstate operations, like for example, Amritpal is absconding. Sometimes he's traced in Uttarakhand, Haryana, UP. Now for Punjab police to chase him and... And Punjab, why are you forgetting Punjab today? Why today is your heart bleeding for a Bhagwan Singh Maan? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're not getting it right. Please allow me to complete my point. The whole idea is... We are of course not getting it right. I mean, I think political parties, political parties, when you are in power of authority, you know, and when you are asked those questions like Ravi Srivastava, they would have done a question. You today are looking at larger pastures come 2024, so you don't want to sound harsh against Bhagwan Singh Maan. When we have a national investigating agency, which can do a much more credible work, it can nab that person. He's a terrorist. He has links with ISI. He has links with terrorist groups. When he's acting like a terrorist, why isn't he dead like a terrorist? So why doesn't the Indo-Pakistan peace is defied? Why? What is the governor doing? Why isn't the governor reporting to the center? Why isn't the president rules being imposed? Is the center's responsibility? Is the Congress suggesting? Are you suggesting that this is a total state of law and order failure in the state of Punjab? And this is why the center needs to step in? Are you saying that? When the issue comes with respect to terrorism, a threat to the state, secessionist movements, it is the center's responsibility. It is the center who's supposed to act. It has to. There are agencies like NIA, there are CRPF, they have the governor's article 356, article 365. Of course there are and there is also an authority like the chief minister. Why isn't the center acting? That's why exactly why I asked. Harish Rai ji, you represent the Shiromani Akali Dal. Now the Shiromani Akali Dal also many say is today guilty, perhaps should take some bit of blame in letting these Khalistani elements rise in the state of Punjab. Dhanaji. I totally disagree with you, but I will tell you this is a perfect operation going by the script which has been created. A Janala happened 40 kilometers by the center and state both. They both are hand in glove with each other. They have a vested interest in it. They want to polarize the next elections. That's what it is. You see the 40 kilometers they walk with the Guru Granth Sahib, police doesn't know. They so-called attack police station and they kneel down. Whole police, whole state kneels down. 30 days, no action, nothing. The man is over ground, he's not underground. Then he's not arrested the way police arrests. They should have arrested him at midnight, early morning. Go and surround his village. He's known in the village. He's daily seen in the village. Why? Why not? Why it's allowed that he goes on a road in a convoy, then they follow it, then they picturize it, then they say not a single bullet fired. I doubt whether he's a terrorist. I doubt whether they are so deeply involved the way it is projected now. They never had weapons, sophisticated weapons, daily weapons are coming. No, no, no, no. Dhanaji, I'm a little confused. Are you, is that sarcasm, sir? Is that sarcasm or you really believe that someone like an Amritpal today should be put behind bars and there should be severe, severe implications for him considering the kind of provocation he's wanting to create? It's not my job. It's the job of the state to do it. Whether the state is really honest in it, whether the state really wanted to arrest him. If they were seriously honest in arresting him, why he was allowed to get out of his village? Why they were following him for many kilometers? Then had a plain policeman standing at a one bridge. Then he comes to know that police is standing, he changes his course. This is not believable. This is, this is not a Hindi film going on. This is a serious task that police is on to. Is it believable that police will not, if they were really wanted to arrest him? Who do you think, Dhanaji, because you know, today, today, today, you're not holding back your punches. Tell me one thing. Who do you think is a real master? Who's the real puppeteer here, according to you? According to me, I personal view, he is a creation of agencies. Now you can't have Balakot, you can't play at this time. Which agencies? Government of India and state. Which agencies are you alluding to, sir? BJP, short of 100 seats. Don't glorify this person. This person is glorifying him. Sir, he, he is a coward. He's having links with ISI. He's having links with terror groups. He's openly preaching, he's openly threatening the Home Minister. Lokesh, Lokesh, let, let, let, let Dhanaji complete his point. Now, Dhanaji, are you saying that he's been created, propped up by the agencies with a particular political motive in mind in the run up to the big elections of 2024? Is that your charge? Situation is being created. Today I have dealt with the clients who have been arrested by the police on flimsy grounds. There's a one man from the Pail, Mathewada village. He was arrested because he was in his de-addiction camp. He got de-addicted. He was roaming with him. He has been caught from his telephone number. One of his nephew sent him a message that I have crossed one border because we know there are thousands and thousands of Punjabis who are illegally migrants of the foreign countries, particularly America and Canada. So why you watch, why is the Akali Dal sitting and watching the state burn like this? Why are you doing this? Why don't you protest? Why don't you raise your voice? Why doesn't Sukrit Singh Badal hold a press conference and expose this link? We are at a receiving end. We have, we have already seen what happened in Bayadubi case. It was again a well planned. We were targeted. Then our people were poached by one party. But you can't shirk away your blame. You can't shirk away Dada Saab that blame. You know, I think what you're getting into is another nuance and another debate here vis-a-vis Punjab and your own political future. Get in Prabalochan. He still hasn't spoken. He's a human rights activist and he also leans towards the ruling dispensation that is the BJP. Prabalochan, who do you think today is at fault? You know, when you have a Ravi Srivastava says that why don't you also ask the centre? What about the centre's own intelligence? Why have they not been able to lab him? And the Akali Dal, they're saying that this is a part of a larger game plan where you have the state and the centre, according to him, getting together to disturb the atmosphere in Punjab. See, you know, what I see here is on the ground, we have an incompetent government and an equally incompetent opposition. The political parties in Punjab, they are not bothered about the welfare of Punjab. They are bothered about gaining political brownie points. When Amritpal is not arrested, all political parties were saying government is not taking any action. When action was initiated, now some political parties are saying that, you know, innocents are being targeted. Okay, so first of all, political parties need to have a stand, which unfortunately, even the opposition parties do not have in Punjab right now. Second, the government, you know, they wasted no time in taking credit about the successful operation that, you know, they executed. And it's a matter of shame that in so many days, you know, I don't know how they term it as a successful operation because the whole motive behind the operation has not been met. Okay, so had there been genuine concern for Punjab within the government or within the opposition parties, things wouldn't have been so bad right now. Punjab is where it is because people trusted a particular party, they formed the government, but that party has let down the people of Punjab and the opposition parties are doing no good. There is no sincerity in any political party right now in Punjab. It will only lead to, you know, you know, I think more than that, what is very concerning Ravi, Ravi is not that the Aam Aadmi Party government in Punjab is a total failure. What is worse is that you're allowing this man to grow, to prosper, to come and snook at you. And the state is surrendering every time. The state is capitulating before him. Ravi, I'll tell you, I'll tell you when Mr. Deep Sidhu hoisted a Nishan flag on Lal Qila in Delhi, what the police was doing, who was in control there in Delhi? Nobody. This man is a driver. Ravi, this is not your time to ask questions. This is your time to respond to questions. Ravi, you're forgetting. The Aam Aadmi Party today is ruling Punjab. You will be asked questions and you will have to respond. Can you tell me whether Amrit Pal will ever be arrested or not? Will Amrit Pal be arrested ever or not? Or will Bhagwan Sigmand choose to resign first? Ravi, we've run out of time, but just tell me this. No, no, Ravi, Ravi, Ravi, Ravi, will Amrit Pal ever be arrested? Will he ever be arrested? Or Ravi, will you suggest that Bhagwan Sigmand should resign because he can't do anything? In how many days? How many months? How many years? Okay, we take your word, but again, we'll have a CCTV footage and he clearly does not know in how many days. Even the DGP does not for the moment has an answer. We've run out of time completely. All right. We are watching. We are watching how long before the state stops this abject surrender before the man called Amrit Pal. Gentlemen, thank you so much for your time. On the other side, back with much more. Amity faculty have filed over 1700 patents. Yet another reason why Amity has been conferred with the National Intellectual Property Award by Government of India for being the top Indian academic institution for patents and commercialization. (Foreign language) The Vajra Congress refused to go to court. They are not sure at all if they even have a case to defend. And so they've been saying flatly so that we are not even thinking of going to court like we are the Gandhis, we don't apologize. But the moot point is that they are not doing what they should. Now, exactly as I had predicted, the opposition unity has completely broken down. The opposition is itself largely perplexed. And I predicted this issue would make news max to max for a week. I was wrong. I was optimistic. Perhaps it has petered out much earlier. Divide, divide, divide. The opposition and the lobby did it during CA. They tried to do it again when Afghans were being evacuated. Tonight it is time to ask them why their secularism comes with a limited comfort zone.

(Music) Trending burning question powered by cool fans. Thank you for joining us on the trending burning question. The biggest political story of the day is that the Karnataka election dates have been announced and with the election the controversies have begun. Cash stash, cash stash in Karnataka is not a new phrase, not a new phenomena. Cash shower is something that we've seen today and corruption likely to be the biggest talking point. Now, cash stash, cash shower, corruption sure to be the most dominating issues in the Karnataka elections as the poll bugle is sounded today. And as the dates are announced, action has begun and with it the controversies. Here's the big headline today from the poll bound state of Karnataka. Just months ahead of the Karnataka polls, watch how standing atop of a bus the state Congress chief DK Shivakumar is throwing cash at the crowd. Watch carefully how the Congress chief is tossing bundles of rupees 500 notes at the voters. On being questioned he called it a ritual. I'm not offered any money to any voter as a case. Indian custom tradition for the floor and the body woman who do the deal. We just give them some small tips to them. That is our tradition. I was on the top, so I just tried to drop that drop that money. Could not transfer. I did not have the connectivity. The BJP came down heavily by throwing notes. They are showing that people are bigger. They think Congress party thinks people are bigger. People will teach him. People are the real owners. But BJP is not untouched from the controversy. Their own MLA got arrested after dodging the law for a while. Put extra pressure and make it clear to all political parties and candidates that money power they have to just zero tolerance which we are showing from our side. Cash and corruption remains in the center as Karnataka goes to polls. And joining us in the trending burning question are Mohan Vishwa BJP spokesperson, Nasir Hussain Ustad, senior leader of the JDS, Amrit Shanoi, leader of Congress and former AICC member. Now Amrit you look at the video and we'll play the visuals right. You see the visual. It's not in fact DK Shivkumar claims it was 2000 rupees that he was giving to a few women which he claimed was ritual right. Look at that visual closely. It's first of all not 2000 rupees alone. Look at that. Just try and see. It's a bundle of notes right. Bundle of notes being thrown. See he flips it easily at least about 10-15 notes right. More than that maybe right. How do you justify it? How do you justify it Amrit? It's okay. You can you can you have every right to question the BJP on the cash stash by the MLA. Virupakshappa I'm not talking about that. How will you justify this first? Start with this. You anticipated that I speak about Virupakshappa. No because that was my question to him because I don't want you to divert. I don't want you to divert. I want you to get I want to get your response on this first. First you ask how do you justify DK Shivkumarji's act. Actually I was not there. Himself DK Shivkumarji clarified no. Just now you only showed the clippings that they were artists and as a good jester. It's a culture to give them some tips. So DK Shivkumarji is not a man. He is a very very experienced person and he belongs to Congress Party. We don't believe in distributing money and winning the elections. So you should ask such questions to BJP. How come 8 put up one BJP MLA Virupakshappa. 8 crore rupees cash. So this is my opening comment. We will see how the other gentleman will react. Please please brush my memory. Try and brush my memory Mohan Vishwa. Was it Actually I won't get Mohan Vishwa because Mohan Vishwa I have another question for him. But Nasir Hussain brush my memory. Was it in the last election right 2019 was it in DK Shivkumar's house where they reportedly found cash during raids. Can you remind me if it was in his house or in his aide's house or something. In Delhi at his residence in Delhi. It was after the MP election. That is a different question. Now the question in debate is the manner in which the Congress president has offered money. His explanation is that he is paying it is a ritual to pay the women folk who remove the aarti. Is it ethical to throw the money. This is not according to the Hindu ethics that you throw money to the women who are taking out aarti. And I don't think this is anywhere in the world in India we have seen women who have been taking out aarti and you standing on a vehicle and throwing money to them. This is totally immoral unethical against the principles of humility. You cannot act like this. Now you say you are paying to the women who are removing aarti. This is not the explanation. I think if it is so it is very much filled with arrogance against the basic principles of the Hindu religion. It is disrespecting the women folk who are coming forward to remove aarti. He said it is a few notes. He said it was 2000. Does it look like 2000 rupees. One minute. It is more than 2000. That investigation it is clear very much clear. Now the question is whether the women who have come forward to remove aarti. See he takes it like this. He takes it like this and he throws. It is not 2000. Look at that. Look at that. The video is clear. I mean there are. Please even to a layman it is clear. And these were 500 rupee notes is what our reporter has also confirmed. Ok Mohan Vishwa my question to you is you can question Shiv Kumar on this right. Now if corruption is the issue if cash and corruption is the issue then how will you justify in the campaign on the 8 crore rupees found in Madal Virupakshappa's house. See Niranjan let me be very clear as far as the investigation apparatus are concerned they are independent. They have found and post Loka Ikta's getting the power from the court you know after appointing Loka Ikta, Apola Ikta. The first right itself was on the BJP MLA and like our Modi ji says na khaunga na khaane dunga. We won't leave anybody for that matter even our own MLA, MPs, power ministers whoever for that matter. But you accept he was found red handed right. No I will give you see I will give you one example what happened in the case of DK Shiv Kumar when he was called for an investigation for CBI and IT. The entire congress, Karekarta's, MLA's, MP's they were on the streets and they burnt the cars. At the same time when Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi has been called for investigation at Delhi entire congress across India made a protest. But look at the case of Madal Virupakshappa when the cash was found in his son's office and also when he got arrested by Loka Ikta. None of his single Karekarta made protest. That's the kind of you know the transparency we have in our state of Karnataka. See in this case also Mr. DK Shiv Kumar who is known for the corruption and what can you expect from a direct disciple of a underworld don, Kothwal Ramchandra. So he was nothing DK Shiv Kumar he made every money only through corruption. Nothing else you can make. Recently there was one more video which was where you know Mr. Sidhram Iyer was telling while going in a bus where they paid 500 rupees each to get the people for their rally and all. So this clearly shows what kind of the corrupt money congress has to do in this election. One minute you spoke about some underworld or some govt once again. You spoke about a criminal. Let me come back to you. What about the 50% commission? Loka Ikta is open. If you have a guts I am telling you the Niranjan show if you have a guts, JDS if you have a guts please go and give a complaint in Loka Ikta. Why you have not given complaint in Loka Ikta? Post that there was three assembly sessions happened. Two in Vidhan Sodha, one in Megha. Why there was no discussion in that? Why there was no complaint? Why there was no complaint? Why was he hiding? Why was he hiding? Why congress, contract association company was hiding? Why there was no single complaint has been filed? One minute, one minute. One minute, why is JDS defending speaking for congress? Nasir why you speaking for congress? Congress will speak no? I am not speaking for congress. You have a free poll alliance with the congress? No you have a free poll alliance with the congress? No, no, is the deal sealed? No, no, is the deal sealed? No, no, one minute. Is the deal sealed? Because we are hearing. No, no, why don't you, since you are speaking Mr. Nasir, why don't you confirm? No, no, because you are speaking why don't you confirm? Listen to my question. Sir, I am asking you a question. Please don't speak over each other. I am asking you a simple question. My question is. What practice in the democratic setup which is found in the… Nasir, Nasir, one minute. Don't speak over each other. I am asking you a question. If you have a gut, go and give complaint. No, wait, wait, let me ask him a question. Mohan, Mohan, Mohan, don't let him, one minute, don't let him escape. I was on another point. One minute, don't let him escape. One minute. Nasir, is it true, is it true that JDS leaders met with congress leaders in Hyderabad? Do you guys have an understanding with the congress? No, no, no question. The unnecessary they are creating, we are fighting both the national parties. Both the national parties have showed their inefficiency in protecting the interest of the state. Here in Karnataka, we have got a single leader. It is Mr. H.T. Kumar Swamy and the people are very much clear that the only wise which can be raised in the interest of Karnataka is Mr. H.T. Kumar Swamy. Unnecessarily, some people say we are the B team of the congress, some people say we are the B team of the BJP. Unnecessarily, this discussion is… Okay, now I am not going to waste time on that. Fine, I got your response. I want to go to Amrit for a minute. Okay, I got your point. Okay, let's keep it short, let's keep it short because… Nasir, I got your point. Nasir, I got your point. I want to go to Amrit now. Amrit, 2019, okay. This is okay, this is from 2029. Shiv Kumar tried to hide illegal cash is what the enforcement directorate told a special CBI court. Okay. 2022 in September, DK Shiv Kumar was summoned in the money laundering case, right. And then once again in July 2022, the ED said that DK Shiv Kumar planned criminal conspiracy with aids to hide cash and they filed a charge sheet which has a series of charges, right. Now, can your party claim that it's squeaky clean on the issue of corruption? I express my doubt that why in last few years ED has not gone behind any BJP leader. So that itself shows that whatever Shiv Kumar is facing, it's nothing but political vendetta. ED was behind Rahul Gandhi also, but they could not prove a single allegation. ED has enquired Rahul Gandhi for 52 hours continuously last year. So, the Modi government is misusing all the institutions, especially investigative institutions to suppress the voice of opposition. So, you can't say that DK Shiv Kumar is a corrupt just because ED has told something. ED is not credible nowadays. He is working to save the BJP government and press the opposition. Are you saying that the pictures of the cash stash that came out in 2019. You again come to. No, I'm asking you. See, you are referring to the cash stash that was found in the BJP leader's house. We know about that. The Lokayukta said it. But it was my first question to Mohan Vishwa. I'm asking you. The cash stash that was found reportedly, allegedly in Mr. Shiv Kumar's house in 2019. Was that real or was that fake? Shiv Kumar has given his explanation and he is facing trial in so many cases. But no allegation is proved till date. So, I said when you are showing some pictures of Shiv Kumar distributing some cash where your own channel got clarification from him. I have heard in another video also. Yes, he has clarified but nobody is saying that's the gospel truth. Wards of cash. And throwing wards of cash. I said you should have asked BJP spokesperson what is his reaction on the cash seized at Virupaksha. Why Virupaksha is not expelled? And he mentioned that no BJP worker did protest. But when Virupaksha got bail, so many BJP workers celebrated just like it's a victory when he got the bail. Now, it is not BJP government or Modi government is arresting him. It's Lokayukta police. We have a faith in Lokayukta and it's an independent body. Then will you believe in Lokayukta? Will you believe in Lokayukta? How can you have double standard? At one side you say ED is in favour of BJP. Now in Karnataka, suddenly Lokayukta becomes totally independent. What kind of double standard people are paying over here? Please explain to the people or what is public putting? You show me ED raiding any BJP fellow all this year. Come on Mr. GM, Siddharth Swamy, who is receiving MP from Dhankera? Wasn't it the Congress party which was against Lokayukta? One minute, one minute, one minute, one minute. You are praising the Lokayukta. I am very happy. I am completely for the Lokayukta crackdown and corruption. But isn't it the same Congress party which made the Lokayukta ineffective? Nasir, tell me. Wasn't it the Congress party that made the Lokayukta ineffective? Fact or fiction? Look, the Bharatiya Janata Party in power has reduced the power of the Lokayukta and the Congress has done the same thing. Congress is not very much clear about the Lokayukta, empowering Lokayukta. Congress was the one who removed the powers to be entrusted to the Lokayukta. Now, the manner in which the central investigation agencies have been used by the Bharatiya Janata Party, that also is a matter of question. How they are targeting the opposition, that also is a very big thing. Can I come in? Can I come in please? BJP and Congress, both are very much in favour of corruption. They do not have the commitment to fight against the corruption. This is very much clear. Let us not argue about which party is more corrupt or which party is not corrupt. The issue is, be it the BJP, be it the Congress, the commitment to fight against the corruption is the same in both the parties. This is the... Niranjan, Niranjan, I want to make one comment on this JDS. One minute, Mohan, one more. I have to ask you a question, Mohan, one minute. I have to ask you a question. See, we saw the pictures of how this BJP MLA was arrested. He was caught red-handed trying to leave a, you know, he was caught at a toll booth. He was arrested. Very dramatic arrest, right? But why did your party let it come to that? How did he go absconding? He had chest pain, but doctor said he is perfect. I am asking, one minute, I am asking you a question. How did you let him escape? See, because eventually when you campaign on the issue of corruption, this will remain and people will ask you questions on how the party tried to go slow. How did he abscond? How did nobody find him? Now, these are some of the questions that will remain, right? Mohan Vishwa, you can't dodge these questions. And your party hasn't expelled him or suspended him, right? See, Niranjan, people at the same time, they are also watching the fact that BJP is up against corruption on its own MLA. So, that's the bigger breaking news over here which everybody in Karnataka is watching. They are appreciating. If you see social media or if you talk to any character, they are with us. They are telling that, you know, that party will take a decision at the appropriate time and he is getting investigated. Now, I want to expose JDS double standard over here. No, I will tell you one thing. Mr. JDS spokesperson, just keep quiet for a minute. I want to expose your double standard also. He speaks about corruption, Niranjan. I want to tell you one more thing. In 2018 election, when Congress and JDS formed an alliance, they were there for 14 months. Mr. Kumar Swamy was the chief minister with Congress for 14 months. In those 14 months, there was a zero effort from Kumar Swamy or JDS to activate Lokayukta. Why didn't they do it? And there were 52 cases pending in Lokayukta against Siddharam Iyer. They joined hands with Siddharam Iyer. Mohan Nasir and Amrit. Mohan Nasir and Amrit. Mohan Nasir and Amrit. Mohan Nasir and Amrit. Mohan Nasir and Amrit. Mohan Nasir and Amrit. I will tell you. Nasir, Nasir. Okay, Nasir, 30 seconds after the end of the debate. I will give you 20 seconds. 20 seconds after the end of the debate. 20 seconds. Respond to him in 20 seconds after the end of the debate. The Bharatiya Janata Party government in Karnataka has nothing to say. It is very much clear. It is very much transparent. The entire legislature, the ministers, the chief ministers, they are falling behind money and 40% commission is being taken throughout the grass root level to the top level. And it is very much clear now the verdict has to come through the voters of Karnataka. I am sure that the people of Karnataka will teach this corrupt Bharatiya Janata Party and the corrupt Congress Party a lesson and we will elect a secular government here which is led by Mr. H.D. Kumar Swamy. Okay, now okay, okay. Now, I have run out of time. I have run out of time. One second. I have completely run out of time. Amrit, Mohan and Nasir. But you know the funny thing today, the funny thing today is that the same Congress Party which is praising the Loka Yukta in Karnataka is condemning the Loka Yukta in Kerala. And the same BJP which wants the Trinamool Congress to suspend or expel its MLAs or leaders in Bengal is not suspending its leaders also arrested for corruption in Karnataka. So you see, there are double standards in every party. And you will have to accept that the election campaign has just begun. And it's going to be a long one.

 The leaders of Congress are coming from different parties. DK Shivakumar is encouraging the new leaders. He is encouraging them to come to Congress. What is the calculation behind this? DK Shivakumar and Sidramaiah are keeping quiet about this. Even though they are keeping quiet, DK Shivakumar is encouraging the other parties to come to Congress.

 It is a job that needs to be done fully. The bus pass was given to Priya Mahalaya, in the manifesto, she was given a mark, her budget was over. Nothing was left. Now, I am announcing the election. Do you remember? Baburao Chitrasura was called up in the OR and asked to go to the toilet. During the election, during the Singhi election, no ST category was there. That is why Baburao Chitrasura has become a big issue for the society. We have asked for 15% and 14% from the lawyers. They have asked for 5% too. We are asking them to give us 2-2% We are saying that the Congress party when it came to power they gave us 2-2% We do not have that satisfaction. We have taken away the ST category and decided to give it to the society. We are not asking them to give it to someone else. We are asking them to give us the ST category and we will give it to them. We are not discussing about the ST category and ST category. We are discussing about the ST category and ST category. They are being punished for 9th and 12th and for the internal register situation. We are asking them to do it legally. Whatever they do, do it legally. We are not doing it legally. All the other CMs and the old CMs who have been punished, they are saying that they are the ones who are doing the wrong. We are asking them to do it. We are asking them to do it.

When will you do it? I am not the one who is going to do the CEC meeting. Mallikarjan Karage has signed it. Sir, all the CMs have come. Is there any problem? There is a lot of tension. Sir, in some theatres, they are saying that we are giving the name of Samudra Duttaraj. It is a Congress party. It is happening in all the parties. BJP is doing something. Why are they keeping the list of people who are going to be announced? They are announcing it till 7th. There are internal problems. There are internal problems in the public. There are internal problems. Last time, the last time, the mafia was there. They have given the name of Avaraj. They have included Madhubangarappa. They have included all the people who have stood up for other parties. They have included the people who are JDS. Yesterday, BJP went to Dalda and included them. They have asked our party. We have told them that we have become anti-NCM because of you. Nobody has included their name. We have not received anything. So, it is in all the parties. But, they are running against BJP. They are doing a public protest. Sir, in HNSNK, it is being included in the Congress. BJP and JDS. But, in the Valsika Sachivar inquiry, it has come to the discussion. Sir, will they also join the Congress? I am not going to talk about all that. I am not going to talk about all that. I am not going to talk about all that. Sir, the people who are in the front of the party, they have said that they have been beaten up. Yes, they have said that they have been beaten up. They have done a protest. Sir, is Rahul Gandhi's program fixed for the 9th? Or is it for the next? It is for the 9th. We will request them. They will make a film from Delhi. Sir, Vijay Narayan, they will make a film from Varanasi. They will make a film about the protest. They have said that they have heard about the film. Will there be an opportunity for the film?

 In a murder in a border in Sathoor, in the name of moral policing, in the event of moral policing, a murder is happening in your name. I am not going to react immediately to the police officers. I am not going to talk to anyone. Because until the complaint is filed officially, I am not going to talk. But immediately, our local leaders, our block congress, BJP, Shankar, all of them immediately attended the meeting. Within two minutes, I and our MPs received a message. We immediately attended the meeting. The reason for this is, they know that they have filed a FIR against someone. BJP has a lot of links. This is what is happening. I am responsible for this moral policing. I am fixing the CM and the Home Minister. They are both responsible. They themselves were in the moral policing process. They were encouraging us to do something. So, I went and checked all the farmers. They were giving money and receipts. They were doing it without any reason. They were asking for 2 crores, 2 lakhs, 3 lakhs. They were killing them. So, the government is responsible. I am not the CM or the CM. They should be responsible for this. I have tweeted that the Home Minister should be the CM. So, I am doing my job. So, in this way, we have a system that is disturbing the welfare of the people. This is their life. They have the right to do whatever they want. They are doing whatever they want. They are doing whatever they want. In this situation, they are creating a mess. This is a conspiracy. The CMs who are in the government, I am trying to give them compensation of 25 lakhs. If someone is involved in this, they should come to the court. If they don't come, tell all your officers to protect them. Because you all are in the court. If you have an affair with someone, you are giving compensation for that. You are protecting your leaders. This is what is being shown here. If someone is involved in this, they are being punished. What will happen if they are not investigated? If someone is involved in this, I know the government. Thank you. [Music]"

On the same day, I had a plan to get water from Kabini and Vidurapudi to Mysore city and 4 city panchayats. I had a plan to get the cabinet note ready and give it to the next cabinet. Maybe the cabinet could be formed on 29th or 30th. I had a plan to approve this by then. Karnataka State Cricket Academy has made a big effort to get an international stadium to Mysore. We have identified 19 acres of land. But in the middle, there was a lake. The Supreme Court has not shifted the lake as per the order. So, we have found an alternative land. We have found 26 acres of land. We have to move all the files and get it to the next cabinet. For that, we have to meet the secretary of the revenue department, Jairam. We have to get the cabinet note ready and get it to the next cabinet. I had a lot of plans. I thought if I had 2-3 days time, I would have completed all this. I felt sad. So, I am going to tell you some of my thoughts. In the next 18 months, any village in Mysore, Mysore city, No one can say that tap water is not coming to my house. In Jaljeevan Mission and Amrut 2, water has come to everyone's house. We should not say this. In Idiye, in all these years, the only thing we have given tap water is 26 lakhs. Now, after Basaraj Mummai died, Jaljeevan Mission has been doing a great job. Now, we have given 27 lakhs extra to the house. In the next 2-3 years, the source may be a little disturbed. In Idiye and Karnataka, all the houses have tap water. Such a wonderful work is happening. There are 17 big cities. There may be a work called Kasai. In Smart City Project, some people have got grants. In Amrut 1 and 2, we have got grants. All the work is going on. Now, my house has gone to Belgaum. Belgaum has become very good. In Kublidhar, we have got good work. In Tumkur, we are getting good work. In Dhavangere, we are getting good work. In Sumagadh, we are getting good work. When did these works happen in UPS after 10 years? I don't know. We should talk positively about this. People are also recognizing this. I want to tell you about the Jaljivan Mission. In Karnataka, there is no one in the court who is ahead of the old Mysore Bagh. But in the old Mysore Bagh, there is Kabeen, Kaveri, Lakshman Theertha, Hemavathi, Kandva Dam, wherever we go, we have got tap water. But today, the old Mysore Bagh has got a lot of grants in the hands of Basaraj Bommai. I will tell you specifically about Mysore. Some people have suggested me to tell you about Kodagi. They have asked me if I want a railway or highway. I have told them that I don't want. I want to tell you about Kodagi. I have told you about the Jaljivan Mission. In the next 5 to 6 months, even in the 8th and 6th Kodagi, even if no one has got tap water, you should come to the Jaljivan Mission. I have given the sanction for the towers. We need the towers in the DSL. I have given the sanction for that too. We have one highway. From Chandrapatna to Arkul, near the Kodalipet, from Somarpet to Madikeri, from Madikeri to Kuttakogu, we have a route to the village. The RS train to Kuttakogu is also coming in the Bharat Mala 2. We have four-line road from Mysore to Kushalnagar. Mainly, it starts from the top. Before that, we do shoulder widening to Sampaj. We do four-line from Sampaj. We provide connectivity to the coast. We provide good roads for the Kodagi. In the village of Pradhan Mantri, we have completed almost all the roads. I have given the work for the Samsadhan. If anyone has any specific request for Kodagi, please do message us. If I have to tell about Mysore, I have met Ajay Nagarjuna recently. There was a legacy waste in the village. We, Swamana Saheb, have tried to get it back in 2010. There were many obstacles. Despite the obstacles, I sanctioned it and approved the project. I also called for a tender. What happened when I called for a tender, the tender was fixed to the government based on the SR rate. The assessment was not good. So, I retendered and did a new DPR. The new DPR cost 7 lakhs. I prepared a project for 58 crores. All the work was done. I have told you about the work yesterday. It was done by the chief secretary yesterday. It is clear now. There is a committee called judges. In the next week, the judges committee will be formed. We have called for a tender within the last election. There is a National Green Tribunal. There are strict orders for it. So, the election code of conduct is not allowed. So, I am doing the work. I have done the national highway and I have brought the power too. I have also approved the gas pipeline. From next May, when the new government comes, we have to install the pipeline in all the places in the state. We have to install it in 36 cities. We have also got the permission. The land usage rate has been reduced. The land usage rate has been reduced. I want to ask you specifically about Mysore. In all these years, in Mysore, some have won 4, 5, 7, 8 times. Till now, some people have made some kind of an agreement. The king has given the order. The king has given the order. We have made Mysore unique. We have made it to develop the city. The way the highway construction has changed the city. We have made it like that. In the last 7, 8 years, all these things are happening under Modi. On one side, we have Kabini. On the other side, we have Kaveri. We have to give drinking water. To give drinking water, Modi has come. In Amrit 1, from Melapura and Hongal, we have brought 40 MLD, 30 MLD water. Now, in Amrit 2, Kadakola, Ramanalli, Srirampura, Bogadi, all 4 of the city's panchayats,"

 for me, for me, for me, for me, DK shivkumar, what is this? now KPCC, the president is there, for me, why did you deny the parliament seat? I asked him. you asked for JDS, in the samishra government, he said, he said, I have no objection, we were asking, we need it, he said, who told you? salman kumar swamy told whom? MP was with me, then MLA, putraj, now he is in pandipur, he said, he will force DK shivkumar to take our bad onders seat, is that it? I told this to our Nayakrata, Parameshwar saheb, see what is happening like this, he did not see such a big change, ok, I was confident, I am a performing MP, how can they deny me the ticket, I was confident, I am repeating it, JDS did not ask for this seat, Congress surrendered it, I told this to surjaya wala, his party has surrendered the seat to JDS, they said, let us talk about MLA, I said, that is not it, this is what DK shivkumar did, I will repeat it again, DK shivkumar, Parameshwar and I, when I was in western hotel with Kumarswamy, this is what DK shivkumar did, he said, let me be a candidate in JDS, I said, how can I be a candidate for Kumarswamy, I am a congress MP, why should I be a candidate in JDS, I am a member of parliament from congress party, why should I become a candidate from JDS, no it is not correct, you should not say this, you are a responsible person, you are a responsible person, you should not say this, there were the important ministers, Parameshwar, they announced it, Mr. K.C.Venugopal, who is responsible for this, he also joined his hands, Parameshwar knew that we were surrendering this seat, after the surrender, this MP, Bangalore Gramantra MP Suresh, he, Dhruvanarayan, B.N.Chandrappa, Nayak, all came to our house, that day itself Suresh said, if you become a candidate in JDS, I will talk to Kumarswamy, I understood, I refused, you do not talk to me about all this, ok, it was over, I said this directly, to me and to Parameshwar, you are a responsible minister, you have taken responsibility for our party, you should defend it, this is the seat that our member won, out of the 9 seats, out of 74, 9 were won by Karnataka, out of those 9, he is the only one, out of 10, he is the only one in the by-election, why should we give 9 people to one person, give the seat that we should have, give it to our party, if you have fought and taken JDS, I will not fight, JDS has all the rights, we are in Swamishir, I have won the seat, if you say that this seat is ours, I will not fight, what did Devegod say, Kumarswamy said, if we do not want the seat, we have a sitting MP, why should we ask, he will disband, D.K.Sivakumar will disband, then, Devegod said, that the people's campaign, he has forced the people to come and told the Congress leaders, but I have a complaint against the JDS leaders, because you have called me a good MP in the media, and when we came to the home of the MLA to give a speech, you said in front of the media and MLA's, I too am very much interested in becoming a good MP and the first time you have said that you will present the farmer's speech in the Lok Sabha, they will get the right to give a speech, recently, Salman Rahul Gandhi and Venugopal called me, when I was nominated, they called me, you please disband, we promise you, even if it is one seat from Karnataka, we will accommodate you in Rajya Sabha, they did not talk, they did not call, they have not called yet, they have not even said why, they have not even called, they have not even called, they have not even called, they have not even called, so I am doing this with a conscious mind, time and again, you are asking me to finish, do you know the reason, the reason is that in one seat, a small guy, he should not be an MLA, in one seat, MP should not be strong, he is also close to the high command, he should not be strong, this is your bad habit, you could not digest, Muddanmahada, effectively working for Lok Sabha, our district leaders are not ready to tolerate this.

 Today, Vasu and his party members, all three of them were the rulers. Nalakubari, as the JDS Party's ruler, as the Maji Cabinet Minister, as the Chief of Service. I have been praising him since many years. Vasu has not been praised by me. Now, Vasu is praised by neither me nor Siddaramayya. The leaders of this state are always on the side of the leaders. The leaders need change. The leaders need a national party. The leaders need a progressive state. Their unity is not just in Tumkur. Our old Mysore has a lot of strength. Even Sivarangi has come today and expressed his opinion on the state. In the same district, our Kantaraju, who was the Ali Shaskar, has also come to the Congress as a JDS. Manohar, who was the Ali Shaskar from Kolar, has also come as a JDS. Now, even Srinivas Gowda, who was the Ali Shaskar, has also come to the Congress and expressed his opinion. Madhu Bangarapna, who was the JDS leader in Varnalili, or in Davangiri, Rajesh Chetrasi, Devendrappa, they too were JDS activists. They too came. The priest from Bragam, who was JDS activist, has also come. Gadath has also come. In this way, about 37 people, who were aware of the election that was postponed by JDS, are all showing their faces to the Congress. Not only this, BJP's Ali Shaskar, who was born 4 years ago, has also come today and expressed his opinion on the Congress. And Chinchansiri too, who was a BJP member of the Legislative Assembly, has also come. Nimbikai has also come. Our Eluru Appna has come. Badukar has also come. He was a small voter, 550 votes. He too was the chairman. He too has joined the party. In this way, many more people, Manetane, Manjunath, Kunnur, our chairman's son was also a JDS member. He too has come today to support BJP. There is a bigger party. I am continuously putting it forward."

 and fix the narrative and make our state a big scoundrel. You are also answering to that. You are also pointing out what you should not have pointed out in the media. You are pointing out. Some may be pointing out more and some may be pointing out less. But one thing, the state itself has given a name. They have given the name ""The most corrupt government of this country"". The reason I am saying this is They are not interested in the youth and women. The corruption that is happening in the youth in unemployment is not found anywhere in this country. Everyone is a part of this. The ministers are a part of this. The officers are a part of this. The servants are also a part of this. Police officers, DG rank officers are all in jail. Open the OMR sheet. Bring the one in the locker. Talk to the terrorists. Talk to the ministers. Talk to the office officials. The police officers are the agents. They have come out with all the information they need. When we talk about corruption, we say ""Give witness, give witness, give witness"". The witness is the people of this world. The people of this world have given it. So what is this that I am doing today? For our youth power, for our youth revolution, what is the government trying to announce in advance? What is the government trying to do after the end? What is the use of this? Tell me what they want to say in their speech. But what can the people who have the right do? What can the people who don't have the right do? I am asking you this question. Number 2, I am a member of the Congress. I think we should not talk about caste. But they have gone to change history. To change history, a big effort was made by Basavanna, Kuampu, Narayangodra, Ambedkar, Manta, Mahanvi, to change the history of all of them, in the Patya book, a lot of effort was made. A lot of struggle was made. Now, in the history of Tipu Sultan, they have gone. To make a debate on caste and religion, they have gone. Tipu Sultan has asked two important questions. Now, a new book, Ananth Ashwathayana, Ravi Shobhakar, all of them have come together. And for that, the producer, Munrathan, and Chitra, all of them have come. For them, for Shobhakar, Ashwathayana, and for Chitra, Ravi, all of them, leave it, I don't know if he has gone to school. We have discussed about some of the people who have taught them. They have taught us, where did it come from, they are thinking. The history that we know, the Presidents, came in Vidhan Savudha, and they have gone to teach us. I am not going to discuss about Tipu Sultan. But here, there are at least 50 books in the newspaper. There is history. About Tipu Sultan, what he did, how he lived, how he died, what he did. In KRS, there is a big history. In that, the newspaper, the caste, the colour of the newspaper, Chitra, he himself has written a story about Chitra. What he is doing today, I will show you. Today, I am calling you, as the President of the political party, to do a big debate about this, I have been given the power. Before I do the debate, our Nirmalananda Swamiji, I have been getting a lot of information, there are many incidents, many societies, incidents in Kannada, literature, all of them should come together and do a debate on this. In this way, BJP government, BJP party leaders, have changed the history, and have gone to the opposition. The progress of this, I will bring someone and make peace, that is not important. Nirmalananda Swamiji, I am asking you, you have taken the progress of the debate, and have gone to change the history, and have done a big debate on this. You should do this, you should do this, you should do this, I am asking you to do this. I am doing this for you. This is your responsibility. I am asking all the leaders of Narmada, Nirmalananda, and all the leaders of all religions, and I have said that this is not right, to all the BJP ministers, I am asking all the leaders of all religions, be it the leaders of Veeraseva Mahasamaja, or the leaders of Lingayasamaja, all the leaders of all religions, to change the history, to change the society, if we leave something, the country will have a big problem. Can we change the names we gave them? Can we change their names? What has happened, what have we taught our children in the lessons we have learnt, we should change that. What have they learnt? BJP's WhatsApp University, BJP's WhatsApp University, BJP's WhatsApp University, what is the purpose of this new history, what is the purpose of this new history, we should see this, we should protest, Nirmalananda Swamyji has called a big society, and a big church has been built, to change the BJP's hatred, to bring down the BJP's hatred, to bring down the BJP's hatred, to bring down the BJP's hatred, I have the confidence in Nirmalananda Swamyji, and in Nayakathu, I have the confidence in Nayakathu, I have the confidence in Nayakathu, I have the confidence in Nayakathu, I have the confidence in Nayakathu, I have the confidence in Nayakathu, I have the confidence in Nayakathu, I have the confidence in Nayakathu, I have the confidence in Nayakathu, I have the confidence in

 The court is getting ready for the state religious war. All parties are getting ready to fight in the court. Meanwhile, CM Bommai has launched a new bomb against DK Shivakumar. Before the war starts, he has created a rift by using the weapons that were not in the treaty. Who has done that? -Everyone has done it. We have not decided yet. You come here. The leaders of the Indian party are coming one after the other. 1400 people have applied in 224 states. The number of people should be more to tell the Congress party that there are no terrorists. The state election commission is announcing the day of the big battle. Why has CM Bommai launched a new bomb? You are using the freedom app to kill the chickens. If you do that, you will be paying more than 1 crore rupees. If the parties are trying to win, the KPCC leader has accused DK Shivakumar of being a part of the operation. They are calling our leader to come. KPCC leader's CM Bommai has called our leader to come to Congress. He has said that he has been waiting for you in Eranepatti. He has said that he has been inviting all the leaders to come. DK Shivakumar has been in Eranepatti for 100 seats. He has called all the BJP MLAs and invited them to come. This shows the situation of the MLAs. He has a strong candidate. He has called all the MLAs. Has he called all of them? He has called all of them. He has said that he has not decided yet. Bommai is in a delusion. CM Hariprasad is a fool. CM Bommai is in a delusion. He has called all the leaders to come. We are not in a delusion. The leaders of the BJP are coming. 1400 people have applied. Bommai should have more support to say that there are no opposition parties in Congress. He should have said that there are no opposition parties in Congress. He should have said that there are no opposition parties in Congress. We will know who is coming after they come. But there are many applications from the BJP. After the elections, some people will decide. If they want to come to another party, they should come with the principles. The people have been waiting for 5 years. After the time is over, they will try to come to another party. Let's see what happens tomorrow. The state politics is going on as if the state elections are being announced daily. CM Bommai has created a new bomb and a new wave. NERSE FOSTER BUREAU"

 In my constituency, in a bar called Sathunali In the name of moral policing In the name of moral policing A murder has been committed I did not react immediately Immediately I went to the police officers I spoke to everyone Because, until the official complaint is filed against Bala Daisy I did not speak to anyone But immediately, I went to the local leaders Our block congress leader Vijay Nivedha Peradare Shankar Nath, all of them immediately attended the hearing Within 2 minutes, I and my MPO received a message We immediately attended the hearing The reason for this is They know that they have filed an FIR against someone BJP and Balalik are involved This is what happened What is moral policing? I have been responsible to the Chief Minister and Home Minister They are both responsible They are involved in the moral policing They are encouraging people to do what is right and wrong So, I will go and check all the farmers They are taking money from the rich They are giving money and giving receipt They are not doing anything They are doing whatever they are told to do They are doing whatever is written in the law They have been given 2 crores, 2 lakhs, 3 lakhs They have been killed So, the government is responsible I am not the Chief Minister Rajinam They should be the ones to take responsibility I have tweeted that Home Minister Rajinam should be given responsibility I am updating it In this way, in all our election time We have to trouble our poor people This is a big problem This is their life They have the opportunity to do whatever they want They are doing whatever they are told to do In this context, they are creating a mess This is a crime The Chief Minister should be given compensation of 25 lakhs I am updating the government Whoever is involved in this They should be given compensation If you are not coming All your officers should tell them that you are protecting Because all your photographs are being published You are giving compensation for all that You are protecting your leaders This is clearly seen here If someone has killed your wife, your son, your wife's mother-in-law If someone has killed them If there is no investigation, what should be done?

 If you ask them about the Meeslati issue, they will say that the Edurappu family is lying Edurappu family is not the CM, Edurappu family is not the government's representative In the Meeslati issue, the CM has created a big ruckus Now the home minister wants to bring Edurappu family back to the centre stage The CM has now gone to Edurappu's house to have breakfast and to discuss the issue with the home minister Now the reason for Edurappu's family to be brought back to the centre stage is a BJP conspiracy They want to bring Edurappu's family back to the centre stage The CM's family has been brought back to the centre stage The CM has no power, if he had power, he would have been a stone-hearted person The BJP has no relation with the people of the state That is why they have been sitting in front of the national leaders in the morning and evening They have been threatening everyone, asking them not to go to the right or left, not to talk to anyone They have been threatening everyone and are running around in a tight manner The CM has been brought back to the centre stage to create a big ruckus There are three statements, one is that the Pralaya Joshi is the president of the Congress The other is that the CM has said that Edurappu family will not blame anyone Look, the question is not to talk to Edurappu family, but to leave them I am also the party's president. This is a mess in the state itself The Supreme Court has come to a judgement against the law The two ministers have sat against it and said that they have done it in the cabinet Where is the backward class commission? The interim report was given in December Can anything be decided in the interim report? The Constitution should be amended. There may be an interim resolution or something else It should be done in a proper manner They have done a gimmick for the election and have reduced the number of people Why is there a reduction in the number of people in this country? There is a large population in this country. We have been asked to give them to Vakalar Swamiji or Lingayat Swamiji Or have we asked them? We have asked them. Ashok has given 12% or 15% of the population They have taken 2% and given us 4% extra. What extra have they given? How much is the population of our people? How much is the population of Veerasha Veerudu? We have done something special for both of us. They have given us 56% and given us more They have given it to both the communities They have given us 4% of the population. They have given it separately Why are you doing it to us? You are giving food to Vakalars, Lingayats, Veerashas We are all farmers. We are the ones who feed the society We are the ones who grow the crops. We are the ones who feed the people Why are you troubling us? Don't trouble them. They are Hindus. They are here We are not agreeing to any of the things.

 We are all from Veerekiala. Our Charaka department has a convener, has a chief executive, has a chief executive. If you call everyone Charaka, then it is a great friendship. We are open for the new year. From tomorrow, Ramzan will also begin. Today is a day in my life, which I will remember for the rest of my life. The reason is, on the 23rd of March, I will be driving an auto. I have never driven an auto. I have driven a motorcycle, I have driven a scooter, I have driven a car, I have driven a jeep. Today, I have driven an auto. Today, I have become a member of your family. I am very proud to say that I have become a member of your family. You are leading a selfless life. You should not think of yourself as an auto driver. You are a member of the nation, a member of the society, a common man, a middle class, a good person. So, I want to tell you, in this country, in this world, in this society, you do not have a caste, you do not have a religion. You, Bala, with confidence, with you, the people of this society, my wife, my sister, my brother, everyone, wherever you are called to go, you are doing a sacred work of bringing about a change in their lives. I will say a word. ""Akshikasya prabhavena shilam bhaji shankara"" That is, the influence of the archer can be seen in the statue. That is, if you want to go to God, to the priest, what will you say? Priest, God cannot hear. The priest's face, this priest will give a connection between this devotee and God. So, in everyone's life, if someone wants to achieve something, if they want to live, you, to all the people who are suffering, to the people who are suffering, to those who do not have their own strength, you make a connection with them, you have become a refuge for everyone's life. You have done such a sacred responsibility. You have taken the position of trust. For that, I request you all to come and offer Namaskara."

 But the other important thing is that in my constituency, in a borderless Atul, there is a murder in the name of moral policing. I am not going to react immediately to this. I will have to talk to the police immediately. I will have to file an official complaint with the DIC. I will have to do that. My local MPs, my block government MPs, Vijaydev, Shankar, all of them have made an immediate allotment. Within two minutes, I received a message from my MPO. I made an immediate allotment. I know that they have filed an FIR against someone. They have written a lot to the BJP. I am responsible for the moral policing of this place. They are very responsible. They were encouraging me to do something about moral policing. I have checked all the accounts of the farmer. He took money from the bank and took out a receipt. He did whatever he wanted to do. He did whatever was in the law. They have killed him for 2 lakhs, 2 lakhs, 3 lakhs. So the government is responsible. I am not the Chief Minister Rajinam. I have tweeted to the Home Minister Rajinam to take care of this. I am doing it alone. So in this way, in all our election time, a big system that is troubling our small population. This is their life. They have the right to do whatever they want to do. They will do whatever they want to do. In this situation, they are creating a ruckus. This is a joke. I have informed the government that the Chief Minister has to pay 25 lakhs compensation. If anyone is involved in this, they should come to the court. If they do not come, tell all your officers to protect them. I have photographs of all of you. If you have an affair with anyone, you are giving all of them pressure. You are protecting your leaders. This is what is being shown here. So if anyone has killed your party, your leaders, your Saa party, and they are trying to kill you, what should happen in the next few seconds? If anyone has a case of corruption, I should be the one to take care of the government. Mr. Basaraj Bombayawalli is responsible for this. He increased it. We had raised our voice at the time of his statement also. You can recall his statement on the Maral policing. He is responsible. He holds responsible. All the leaders in the name of the affair who is there, the police has been identified. It is in my conscience. I am in touch with all the police officers. I did not speak till some clarity would have come. I have got all the photographs of all the leaders which he has been accompanying where the affair is there. Immediately police has to take action. Home Minister has to resign. 25 lakhs of compensation should be paid to him. It is a boy from Mandya. It is a very great incident. The parents also did not allow. The relatives did not allow it in a private hospital. We have shifted to a government hospital. That was the demand. I think the process is on. I don't want to involve in the investigation. But compensation has to be paid. The culprits have to be arrested. That is not the issue. Let the law take its own course. The law should take its own course. It is a crime to do it to anyone. Has anyone asked me to give the money to the dead? They are trying to create a war in this small country. We have said that. They have asked us to give the money after the people's security is restored. The society. What is the proof you have taken? I am working under the constitution. I have taken all the documents.

 On one hand, Siddaraman is saying that Congress is now ready for the elections. On the other hand, the phone call war between D.K. Shukumar and CM Bommai is getting worse. D.K. Shukumar is calling our party. He is calling our party to come to Congress, the CM said. D.K. Shukumar has called to give 100 seats in the second batch. There are 800 seats left in the second batch. He is calling to give them. The CM said that he has called openly to all parties. So, D.K. Shukumar is now giving counter to the CM's words. D.K. Shukumar is saying that he is coming to find out what he should call. What did the CM say about the phone call? What has D.K. Shukumar reacted to it? Let's see. I am aware that D.K. Shukumar has called to all BJP MLAs and said that he will give them if they come. He has called to many MLAs. This shows his situation. He has called to many candidates. He has called to all the MLAs openly. Has he called to all the candidates or only to some of them? He has called to all the candidates openly and said that he will give them if they come. This is a very dangerous situation. But he said that no one will go. He said that no one will go. They are coming to find out. I am not there to accommodate their seats. They are coming to find out where we are. He is saying that he is not there in the candidates. That is why he is calling us. No, they are coming to find out. How did they do their job? Our candidates have done their job. Is the BJP government running today? Pollution government is running. They are saying that the CM is in which party. They are saying to others. The CM is in which party. BJP is running with Jantadal and Congress. How many MLAs are coming from BJP? I am not going to say anything. I don't want to damage them. Are you calling them? We will see where we are comfortable."

He condemned Rahul Gandhi's disqualification as an MP.

n18oc_politics",758,7,15.49,36.98,47.53,"
 So today Congress is planning to protest regarding the disqualification of Rahul Gandhi. I think in Karnataka we'll have a different type of planning because elections are going on. So I have called all the candidates tomorrow. We have to conduct our screening committee also. So I'll have a meeting with all my functionaries because all of a sudden I can't announce in Karnataka because all of them are on their consciences. So it should be a very massive way. That is why I'll have to discuss with all my leaders and we'll chalk it out. But sir, in Karnataka if we really have to talk, Rahul Gandhi got an opportunity to come to state once ahead of the assembly election and now all this happening in and around. How do you see this, sir? See, the people of this country and especially the state, no one is happy with the type of dictatorial attitude what has been going on in the BJP. In democracy without an opposition, no democracy exists. He's the voice of the people. He's a parliament member. He has the right to speak. But misusing various agencies is creating a lot of confusion. The entire country is in fear. Even if you want to speak to any of your close aides, people have to speak on FaceTime or WhatsApp or whatever the security measures are there. So, sir, you're clearly calling this a conspiracy against the leader, I mean, Rahul Gandhi? Yes, definitely. He has become more popular. The younger generation, he has united the country. The youths, unemployment, a lot of issues have been taken up. That is why you want to crumple him. Sir, also my last question, you see how things are all panning out for Rahul Gandhi. Now how exactly is that the Congress Party is planning to move in the election there? No, definitely we'll take this to the streets. We'll convince the people. People know about it. We stand by Rahul Gandhi at any point of time. But as I know him personally, he will not care for this disqualification. He will not care for jail. It is a family which has sacrificed their prime minister post. It is a family which has sacrificed their lives. The blood and the DNA is different from what BJP leaders are thinking. So this brings me to you, ask this question again. You see now the BJP is also demanding an apology from Rahul Gandhi that he has insulted Savarkar and also the OBC community. Where is the OBC community? Which OBC community? How can a prime minister candidate or anyone think of any OBC community? It is a national level politics. He is a prime minister. What OBC community is that? There is no OBC or nothing. What was supposed to be spoken, he has spoken. Judgment has come. We don't want to dispute on any judgment issues. How, what, what will happen? But there is a law in this country. I still feel that law will, injustice will not be flown from the seat of justice in the higher courts."

 Hello and welcome to superfast50. Fugitive Amritpal Singh releases new video amid news of his surrender. Video came after it's being reported that Amritpal might surrender to Punjab police after having been untraceable for the past few days since March 18th. In the video, the radical preacher has asked his supporters and followers to call for a gathering at a single place and launch a big protest. Dozens of police officers are on standby and guarding every inch from the entrance of the golden temple to the Akal Takht. This comes as sources claim Amritpal is likely to surrender at the temple where Punjab police have ensured heavy deployment of personnel. After Karnataka Congress leader D.K. Shivkumar was caught on camera throwing 500 rupee notes from the roof of a bus during a rally in the poll bound state, the KPCC chief has defended himself saying he was just trying to give the artists a small tip as part of Indian tradition. I have not offered any money to any voter. As an Indian custom, tradition for the folk and for the women who give the tilak, we just give them some small tips to them. That is our tradition. I was on the top, so I just tried to drop that, drop that money. Could not transfer, I did not have the connectivity. Some 2000 rupees or something to four of them, I just, because a lot of women was there putting tilak and flock artists were there. I am not a fool. I am also a matured political leader. I know what is my responsibility.

Amid massive protests in Karnataka over the quota reject there, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai cleared the air, said facilities have been given to all communities, it is the Congress and not the BJP that does appeasement politics. We are talking to them and all misgivings are there, it's a Congress plan to misguide these communities.

The allegations made by the short seller Hindenburg were however rejected by the Adani Group. Left wing governor Manoj Sinha says J&K is last in the country to come under the purview of property tax, saying there was no state or city in the country where property tax has not been imposed. This year's budget is the first budget of the Amrit Kaal. I think that J&K should be developed and should be consolidated. This is the third time the budget has crossed the 100,000,000 crore mark.

 There was a CWC meeting as well. To find the last two persons from the party, from Karnataka, Maj. M. Siddaramayya, D. K. Shivakumar, some of them went. In the meeting, AICC President Mallikarjunakar, Rahul Gandhi, K. C. Venugopal, Surjewala, all of them joined. The party is the last one, it will be released. Now, they should give their knowledge about this. The leaders themselves are talking. There are 3 people. If you see, there are 4 people in the front line. Siddaramayya, D. K. Shivakumar, Surjewala are there. Surjewala is also talking. It was promised by the I. N. C. Karnataka, Indian National Congress, our leader of the C. L. P., our P. C. C. President, and all other senior leaders. The Congress party was the first one to release its first list of 124 candidates for the ensuing Karnataka Assembly elections, much before the Code of Conduct. I am happy to again remind you that our choice was unanimous without any differences. The Screening Committee and the Central Election Committee met again today. We have again decided on a number of seats, which you will know once we release the seats by late today. And again, unanimously, the Screening Committee and the Central Election Committee have decided a further list of candidates. The 40% Commission BJP Sarkara in Karnataka has floundered and failed. The so-called double-engine Sarkara is double droha for Karnataka. It's a double betrayal for Karnataka. Modi government betrays Karnataka on one hand and Bombay government brazenly loots Karnataka on the other hand. The way in which BJP leaders are leaving BJP in Karnataka by hoards over about 10 MLCs and MLAs of BJP have already left Bharatiya Janta Party expressing no confidence in Bombay government. In fact, as we speak now, senior most BJP leaders along with other senior leaders of the BJP are doing or observing prizeship devas in Mysuru on Gandhi statue for having elected a BJP government. It's a sinking ship which is on nose dive. Neither PM Modi nor the corrupt Bombay government can save it. Congress party has given a positive agenda under the leadership of Shri Siddharamaiah and Shri D.K. Shivkumar and other senior Congress leaders. The four Congress guarantees Gray Lakshmi scheme, 2000 rupees to every woman head of every household every month to fight inflation. Gray Jyoti scheme, 200 units of electricity free every month to every house. The Anna Bhagya scheme for our BPL family, brothers and sisters 10 kgs of rice free every month. And Yuva Nidhi, a unique scheme unveiled by Rahulji whereby every graduate of Karnataka for 2 years after graduation if he or she is unemployed between 18 to 25 years of age will get 3000 rupees and every diploma holder will get 1500 rupees every month for a period of 2 years. All these schemes itself amount to transfer of 80000 rupees every year to every family of Karnataka. This is the Nyaya concept conceived by Shri Rahul Gandhi in the year 2019 that under the leadership of our PCC president and our CLP leader we are seeking to implement. I also lastly want to say before I call upon my CLP leader and PCC president a section of BJP is jittery. They are running scared and helter-skelter. They are seeking to plant fake and false stories through a section of news media outlets. We reject them in toto. They are sometimes misinterpreting the interview given to them by Shri Siddharamaiah. Sometimes trying to misinterpret the words of our PCC president. Sometimes they are leveling guns at Dr. Parmeshwar or MB Patil. Sometimes they level their guns at me. But the Kannada media friends who meet us everyday they know that the Congress party is completely united. It is BJP which is failing to now, which is now not recognizing even Basavaraj Bombay. His pictures have disappeared. They are insulting Mr. Yadurappa on a daily basis. And there is complete chaos in BJP. There is complete unity, unanimity as also a commitment to rebuild brand Karnataka. And on the other side there is corruption, there is commission and there is chaos and confusion. That's the difference. Before I... Ok I will answer that also and then we will move forward. I also want to say we are not hankering for post and power. Post and power is a direct consequence of service of the people. We are going to be elected with 150+ mission that Sri Mallikarjun Khadge and Sri Rahul Gandhi has given us. So we are not hankering for post and power. Yes, aspiration is good in politics. Siddharth Mayaji has said, even Mr. D.K. Shivkumar has said. Aspiration is ok, but our final aspiration is to form the next Congress government with 2/3rd majority in service of the people. I will now request Sri Siddharth Mayaji and then Sri D.K. Shivkumarji to say few words and then we will take a few questions. Siddharth Mayaji. Yesterday, I have given an interview to one electronic media. Said in the interview that I am also an aspirant for the Chief Minister post. Likewise, Mr. D.K. Shivkumar is also an aspirant for the Chief Minister post. The aim of both of us is to defeat BJP and to bring back Congress party into power. And the ground reality in Karnataka is there is a wave in favor of Congress party. BJP is going to be defeated. My statement in the interview is misinterpreted. What I said was, I am also an aspirant, D.K. Shivkumar is an aspirant. There is nothing wrong in democracy. Whoever may be the aspirant for the highest post. M.B. Patil is an aspirant, or Parameshwar is an aspirant, or D.K. Shivkumar is an aspirant. If I am an aspirant, ultimately the newly elected MLAs will have to elect the leader of the Legislature party. After the election. Not now, after the election. And ultimately, High Command has to take a decision. That is what I said. I never said, I never said, High Command is not happy with D.K. Shivkumar or M.B. Patil or anybody, any leader. Never said. And this is what I said. And in Karnataka, there is a strong anti-incumbency against BJP government. Because BJP government is a corrupt government. Karnataka never come across such a corrupt government in independent India. So this is a corrupt government and 40% commission government. And there is a misrule, there is a, they have not done anything to the poor farmers, backward communities, and women, labour community. See, after they came to power, not on the mandate of the people they came to power. They came to power through Operation Kamala. So they are looting the state. The financial position of the state is very pathetic. So the BJP is responsible for this position of the state. So that is why people have decided to throw this government out and to bring back the party, Congress party, into power. That is what I said and this is the truth. Whatever is reported in newspapers or in electronic media, it is totally false. Thank you sir. May I request BCC president to say a few words and then we will take a few questions. So thank you for waiting for all of us. You know, you all will be all over in election committee meeting. For all of us, 60-70% we have all unanimously we have decided and rest we will take some time to discuss the other issue. As rightly said, our aim is only to bring Congress party to power and we will deliver. We will deliver a good government, a government with a governance. We will see that the most corrupt state which has been already given a boon from the BJP will be vanished. I am very happy that all of you are also waiting to have a good beginning at the South India and Congress party will come to power. We all stand together, we work together, we will bring Congress party together. Are you upset with Mr. Sidhramayya's statement? I am not upset with anyone. I know what Sidhramayya's heart is, I know what my heart is, I know what your heart is. We all will win. Our aim is to bring Congress party and you all have to walk and meet us at Vidhan Sodha. So our heart is clear and so should all of you be. Thank you. Okay, Congress leaders have spoken after the meeting. Once again, Sidhramayya has given clarification. Before this, Mr. Surjewala has again taken the BJP government to the streets. 40% commission government, now itself 10 rulers have left BJP, have given up the faith. Mr. Surjewala said that we will all work in the direction of bringing Congress government. Sidhramayya has given the clarity only in relation to the discussion of the opportunity given yesterday. DK Shivakumar also spoke. He also clearly said that we will give good governance."

#KarnatakaElections2023 #dkshivakumar #kpcc #dks #Congress #BJP #evm #karnatakaassemblyelection2023 #karnataka #englishnews n18oc_politics",616,6,19.95,30.72,49.33,"
 And after the poll announcement, KPCC President Spaks speaks exclusively with CNN News 18. He says that he is confident of winning polls but has some concerns about the EVM. So that entire EVM saga is back in the election season once again. Let's listen in to Mr. D.K. Shivbhavan. Sir, poll dates announced. Any apprehensions you have? You had asked for a single-phase election, that's happening. Some of the things we have requested, now we are telling that 80 years of vote, we should be very cautious. And they may try to misuse the government machinery, we will be very cautious on that. I have asked for a rejection on that. I don't know what the government, the Election Commission will do. But still, we will be very cautious. We know that. That is why I have called a batch of lawyers to come here and they will look at it. Sir, Mr. Bumai says you have been calling up BJP MLAs, asking them to join the Congress. I need not call any BJP MLAs. BJP MLAs want to leave the BJP. They know that the government will not come. It is the most corrupt government. That is why BJP is afraid, they are trying to knock, they are threatening all officials. Everyone, MLAs, lock, take their phone numbers, reddit them, threatening them, all of the things they are trying to do, they are misusing their power. Let them do. Mr. Kumar Swamy says he has got an offer from both the Congress High Command and the BJP High Command. They are in talks with them for a tie-up. I am not aware of it. Congress will form its own. We will have 140 seats and you will be a witness to it. Sir, finally, this video that the BJP is tweeting, saying that you offered money to voters in Mandya, how do you justify that whole incident that has happened there, sir? Where is the offer I have given? I have just put a 500 rupee note to an Aarti, that is our Indian tradition, culture. There is a cultural truth. When we see a God, when we see that, we have to give. I was on the top of the bus, I have given. Nothing new in it, nothing important in it. Let them make a news of it. Let them enjoy the show. My colleague Ritu with us on the broadcast. Ritu, the Congress Party says it is ready for the battle. They are also making certain points about EVMs and we have heard this before. Well, all the three parties in the Karnataka are saying that they are all set ready for the battle and they will be entering into the elections with full of confidence. And in fact, all three parties, you see, go on claiming that they will be coming up with a majority, will be winning with a majority and will come back to the power as well. And then a lot of plans that they have. In fact, but with all that, you see the kind of allegations that the Congress has also raised earlier about the EVM. So they're set to be changed right now. So with that, the Congress is happy about it. But meanwhile, you see about the tie up that has again, the issue of the tie up, which has actually come to the fore again, every time, every time during the assembly elections, we have always seen, you see, this kind of a statement and the heated debate, which actually comes into the light often. Similarly, it has come up this time as well, where the Congress is saying that we don't, especially the KPCC chief goes on to say that he's not aware about it. But meanwhile, former Chief Minister Sidhramayya himself said that he has indications that there was there's an internal understanding between the JDS and the BJP. And there you see what Bhomai also goes on to say about that they're having a secret meeting in the Hyderabad for a tie up and the alliance, in fact, for the, in the elections there again. So all that you see, we'll have to see to what, how this whole will come down with the JDS as well. But however, never know that, you know, we have always seen in the decades as well, that how JDS has emerged as the kingmaker again, therefore, and when we talk about the kind of a statement that has always come out from the KPCC, the chief of D.K. Sukumar, where he goes on to say that there's nothing of that sort that the Congress is approaching the BJP MLAs to join the party. But on the other hand, we have seen how many BJP leaders, in fact, the senior leaders, someone like the former, the former minister, Ramesh Jarkhawali, coming out and saying that the KPCC chief is in fact, blackmailing most of the ministers with the different CDs, there again, saying them to join the Congress party. If not, they will release those CDs. And again, on the other hand, we have seen recently when our minister, Narayan Gautam, he also came out to say that the Congress party lacks with the smart leader and the big faces. So that's the whole reason that they are actually getting invitation from the Congress party. But all that you see now, the Congress president also refusing with all that kind of allegations and claims being made from the opposition parties. Ritu, getting us all the details as far as the state of Karnataka, the elections are concerned, it's going to be a single phase election. That's what the election commission announced. Not much gap between the election dates and the counting date. That's when you know the fate of Karnataka. This election, the first big election of the year is also a precursor for the BJP for their big Southern project."

 If Pomma is going to question the MISILATI, it will be a stone in the house of Edurapu Edurapu is not the CM Edurapu is not the representative of the Government In the MISILATI inquiry, the CM has created a big ruckus Now Edurapu has to be brought back to the centre stage The CM has agreed to the leadership of Edurapu and has gone to his home to have breakfast, and has given them all the benches and all the necessary things are in the house. I have not gone to church. Now if a stone is thrown on Edurapu's house, what is the reason? It is a BJP's internal conspiracy. They want to finish Edurapu and finish the politics. If a stone is thrown on the CM's house, it is like that. If there is no authority, the stone will be thrown and the anger will be felt. If they do it on Edurapu, it is an internal fight. BJP has no relation with the internal world. No one has a relationship with each other. They have been sitting at the National Gate since morning and threatening everyone. They have been threatening everyone not to go right or left, not to talk to anyone on the phone. They are running in a very tight manner."

 We have been discussing about BJP's strategy to target Sidramaiah. In the upcoming part, we will see which of the hidden tricks are in the list of BJP. Dhanesh, it is not possible to target only Sidramaiah. There are many tricks. In that, who has made the short list of BJP? What have they planned to do? Sidramaiah, KPCC, DK Shivakumar, MP Patil, Sidramaiah has made a list of 10 BJP's. Because, who all are influential, who all are influential in the society, due to their caste, power, or due to their connection with the people. So, to see them differently, who all are influential in the society, power, or due to their connection with the people. So, not only their area, but also other areas are also influential. Yes, exactly. Other than their area, there are also people who are connected. So, we can target those who are influential. For example, KPCC's D.K. Shivakumar. I have explained D.K. Shivakumar in the graphic. D.K. Shivakumar, for being the KPCC's President, and for being the leader of the single-legged community, he is influential in many other areas. In that, in Old Mysore, for the single-legged communities, he is influential in some areas. For that reason, we have got information that he is also being targeted by BJP. D.K. Shivakumar's MP party, Triyankar, KJ, George, all of them are also being targeted. So, if we look at D.K. Shivakumar's issue, we have to find out a popular single-legged leader against D.K. Shivakumar. Because, last time, a person named Nandini Gowda was found. She did not even go to the temple. This time, if we find out another influential leader, then we can control D.K. Shivakumar in the area. Not only that, in four areas of Ramnagar, if we calculate the single-legged communities, then BJP can increase the single-legged communities. That too, can create a positive impact on D.K. Shivakumar. Such a single-legged community, we have found a person, Dr. Appaji Gowda. Dr. Appaji Gowda is a person who is a member of the same committee. He is a famous person. He is a former president of the state single-legged association. So, he has a network among the single-legged communities. That can work for him. That is why, it is estimated that it will be convenient for BJP. In fact, if we calculate Dr. Appaji Gowda, he is also an activist, he is in the consciousness. He has appealed to BJP to give tickets to any area of Ramnagar. BJP is able to consider him. Because of the single-legged factor. It seems that D.K. Shivakumar should be restricted. Because now, D.K. Shivakumar is on the safer side. His popularity is increasing. He is not seen from the media. He is not even in BJP. I said, Nandivin Gowda last time, he did not even get a ticket. So, in this situation, if we put Dr. Appaji Gowda as an example, BJP's luck will be able to be a little convenient for BJP. This was about D.K. Shivakumar."

 Congress is already in the middle of that area. But, why is D.K. Shukumar asking Soman why he is being housed? Siddharami is against Lingayat leader, but still, he is very much for it. Why did D.K. Shukumar give Soman the offence? Coming up, an exclusive breaking news. Congress has a powerful person in the Vijayanagara and Govindaraja Nagaras of Bengaluru. But, why is D.K.

Congress has a powerful person in the Vijayanagara and Govindaraja Nagaras of Bengaluru. But, why is D.K. Shukumar asking Soman why she is being housed? I am your political correspondent Basavaraj Durvani. I am your political correspondent Basavaraj Durvani. I am your political correspondent Basavaraj Durvani. I have been to Delhi, met the leaders. I don't know about other leaders. Our leader Narendra Modi, our leader Amit Shah, our leader JP Nadda, I have not told the names of the leaders. There is a lot of confusion, there is a lot of discontent, there is a lot of misery. I have met the leaders. What else can be done? Basavaraj, I have been reconnected with the political bureau. Basavaraj, good morning. Are you listening to me? Very good morning, Harish. Soman, people will understand that there is a lot of discontent and misery. But, you are still sticking to your party. What is happening? Yes, Harish. There is a lot of misery in the party. I have done a lot of work to get rid of it. But, when the Haleel Sathivur was there, why did he come to the Congress? That is a question that I don't know. A fight between D.K. Shukumar and Pramukhwaji was being surveyed. In Govindaraja Nagar and Vijayanagara, Congress is a little behind. Because it is neck to neck, it is not easy to say who will win. So, if Soman is called to Govindaraja Nagar, it will be convenient for the party. Priya Krishna could have given the ticket to Lok Sabha Chuna one day. Because, in the south of Bengaluru, there is no need for anyone to come. They had made a deal. But, Priya Krishna or M. Krishnath, Soman did not like to be called from Govindaraja Nagar and Vijayanagara. So, they had to offer the ticket to Rajanagara Nagar. Even there, because of the opposition, it is in a little hold. And, because of the strong opposition between them, Soman has also made a deal to give them a peace of mind. So, yesterday, they also left the house and spoke to Amit Shah. Because of the opposition in Congress, they are trying to hide in the opposition. So, now, whether they will reach Congress or not, they are trying to hide in the opposition. So, Soman has come to Congress. Thank you so much Basavaraj. We will update you in a moment."

 the special program of Chunavana Chakra which is being held by News18 today we have come to Kanakapura Vidana Sabha in Ramanagar district let us ask the people of Mathadara who have the right to vote here in Kanakapura we have decided to vote for D.K.Sivakumar the purpose is Kanakapura Taluk is in the Indus Valley as per Nandu's words it is in the Indus Valley Kanakapura has no other place today for Kanakapura farmers in the race for 40 to 60 crore rupees per month the farmers are getting it in the month of May for 20 to 25 crore rupees per month the farmers are getting it in this state in any district or taluk the farmers have so much of wealth in this state it is not there if it is there, it is in Kanakapura Taluk only then so much of wealth is coming to the farmers what is the purpose? the purpose is to build houses for the silk workers to build houses for the chicken workers to build houses for all the milk producers as much as is needed, the rice and other things in this state, for our Kanakapura they have given prosperity in this state, the number one job for the farmers if the farmers are successful in Kanakapura alone, in this state the Indian government has given prosperity to Kanakapura the purpose is DK Shivakumar, DK Suresh the achievement they have done this is the achievement of the farmers so today we in Kanakapura in the highest lead, we are winning over DK Shivakumar what is today? our Indian party now brother has spoken today MG Road our government's achievement is to become a big business and today they said, ""Ingugundi"" our government's achievement is to become that ""Ingugundi"" and today, Somannaura Somannaura Somannaura if we want to do something that is our government's achievement and so, from our government our NECC, the Prime Minister has done many activities NECC, today 7 times, here in Saskarna and MP have been called from the beginning from our NECC from our government what has happened to us, everyone knows 10,000 rupees 10,000 rupees money our farmers, for a year our government is giving 10,000 rupees till today, no one has done anything till today, all that has become zero and so, when BJP government comes our wife says, ""the country is in ruins"" but, I have been a politician from Bajapad for 27 years from the beginning, we should give good representation I have worked for the Taluk Administration from the beginning, we should give good representation we should keep it in our eyes we will really do our work in this context, I am very much angry hello DKC Kumar DKC Kumar has to vote for the Karakpura Taluk DKC Kumar DKC Kumar has to vote for the MG Road this is what our BJP state has said DKC Kumar has destroyed the MG Road DKC Kumar has built the Taluk Office and the Municipality the reason why the Kanakpura Taluk is in ruins is because DKC Kumar is the son of DK Suresh DKC Kumar is the KPCC Chairman he is the one who governs the state DKC Kumar has done a lot of work when the Taluk was built, there was no water in the borewell same way, the Mathur river has no water in the year 2018, the Mathur river was filled with water even though there was no water, the borewell was recharged by 2000 the reason for that is DK Suresh and DK Samsad according to our friend Nanjundappa, the Kanakpura Taluk is the best in the state today, the Kanakpura Taluk is the best in the state even our PM, BJP Narendra Modi has praised our MP I will end my speech here, Jai Hind Jai Karnataka I am a citizen of this state, the son of this state, the son of the Devegode, the son of the Kumaraswamy the people of this state are working hard like farmers and labourers my PM, Kumaraswamy, should be the PM in the future if there is anyone who works like a farmer and labourer, it is only Devegode and Kumaraswamy the reason is, the PM of this state, Kumaraswamy has made the farmers and labourers of this state, the women's union the PM of this state, Kumaraswamy should be the PM of this state I want to tell the people of this state, this was the Badrakot of the people the people of Sindh have worked hard for 25 years the people of Sindh have built the buildings, how much more will it take to build them? in the future, this is the Badrakot of JDS the PM of the future, Kumaraswamy will be there the women's union, the women's union of the farmers, the women's union of the society the women's union of the farmers, the women's union of the society the women's union of the farmers, the women's union of the society the women's union of the farmers, the women's union of the society if the farmers and labourers have to work, the PM should be like Kumaraswamy the son of the Devegode, the son of the M.A. of this state, the PM of the future, Kumaraswamy I will raise the mic a little I want to say something our BJP power is increasing in the vote of Kanakpura Taluk that is why we have decided that our vote will be for the BJP yesterday our friends were saying that Kanakpura was in the 173rd place as per the Nandivendapana's vote it is still the same the farmers have increased their rice crop, so they have to get rice crop the farmers have to get rice crop to get the rice crop in Kanakpura Taluk, the farmers used to get the vegetables from the market they used to exchange the vegetables with the market and get the required quantity today, the farmers have to go to the market and get the required quantity the farmers have to go to the market and get the required quantity this is a question no one is giving a response to the common farmer if the Narega scheme is not implemented, then the farmers in the villages the farmers in the villages, the medical workers, the medical workers, the farmers in the streets if they do not get the required quantity, then the Kerala government will not get the required quantity the power of the Kerala government is Modi if Modi is not wrong, then our vote will be for Modi BJP was saying that Modi has done a good job why do the bad people do good to the farmers? if a farmer goes to the market and asks for Rs.400, Rs.400 is the price for the farmer if the farmer asks for cash, the farmer will be asked to make a betel leaf curry the gas price in the field was Rs.400, but now it is Rs.1100 the farmer is asking for Rs.850, but the farmer is not giving the people who are not standing for the elections should not go to the BJP they should go to the people who are supporting them they should go to the people who are supporting them I would like to tell the farmers that they should get involved in the elections should they get involved in the elections? if they are not involved in the elections, then how will they get the votes? I am not asking you to support them, but you should support them if you are not able to support them, then ask them if you are not able to support them, then ask them I am Ravika Kumarsamy, a

Basavaraj Bommai, the chief minister of Karnataka, attacked the Congress shortly after videos showing DKS doling out cash in the Mandya district appeared, saying the party has used all kinds of dirty tricks to get votes. The development follows CM Bommai's Tuesday accusations that the Congress was attempting to lure MPs from the saffron party. Although having released its first list of 124 candidates, the Congress has not yet distributed tickets for 100 seats in the state.

 breaking news coming in KPCC chief DK Shiv Kumar seen throwing a bundle of 500 rupee notes at a group of performance to were at a Praja Dhwani Yatra in Srirangapatna. Big breaking news coming in of the Karnataka Congress chief who is seen showering money. Let me go across to Deepak on that. Deepak what are the details this is likely to put DK Shiv Kumar in some trouble. All right we'll go back to Deepak in just a moment but look at these visuals likely to bring some trouble for the Karnataka Congress chief DK Shiv Kumar who is seen during a rally throwing a bundle of 500 rupee notes at a group of performance performers. This is during the Praja Dhwani Yatra in Srirangapatna. So the parties have been campaigning extensively and it was during this campaign that DK Shiv Kumar was seen showering money and this is a similar allegation that has been leveled on the other leaders as well. Meanwhile more breaking updates now coming in. Chief Minister Basaraj Gommai is slamming DK Shiv Kumar. Reaction coming in from the Chief Minister. Cash for votes charged against DK Shiv Kumar after this video showed DK Shiv Kumar showering notes on a group of performance. Listen into the Chief Minister's reaction. The government both are ready for elections and we are waiting for the Election Commission to announce the dates and as per that our future programs will be set. Preparations are already underway and for last four months we had several programs from boot level to Sankalpa Yatra, Vijay Sankalpa Yatra and lot of response is there and we are sure to get come back to power with thumping measure. Campaigning strategy give the boost? Yeah yeah campaigning strategy we have met several times we already started it and further it will be speeded up. Alright Deepak dates all set to be announced but we're seeing DK Shiv Kumar in a video throwing notes at performers. Yes it was in Srirangapatna yesterday during the Prajadwani Yatra. As of now no clarification has really come in from you know the Congress chief. He's seen throwing this bundle of notes at a bunch of performers now. Whether the Congress will argue that this was for the performance that they had to be paid but is it the right way to stand on top of a you know campaign vehicle and then throw this bundle of you know notes. Definitely will draw in sharp criticism from the BJP and the JDS combined. Right alright Deepak thank you for joining us with those details."

 Welcome back to our breaking update. What we are getting to know that an FIR has been registered again, DK Shivakumar, by the Mandya police under the section of bribery, where apparently he could be seen throwing cash from top of a bus during his rally that he was conducting in Mandya, and a complaint that was given five days back, with the FIR now having been registered. Karnataka Congress President, DK Shivakumar, was being booked for throwing currency notes at the people during an election rally on Monday on the 29th of March, as the Election Commission of India has registered a complaint against the Congress leader for showering currency notes on people at a poll rally, based on which a non-cognizable offense that has been registered against him. And based on the complaint, a local court had issued directions to book the Congress leader, following which the Mandya rural station had registered a case against him. Now, in the video that also went viral, DK Shivakumar could be seen standing atop a bus and throwing currency notes at the people taking part in the election rally. And he was then taking out the Congress's Prajadhwani Yatra in the run-up to the elections that will be now taking place in the state. However, he has defended his stance, saying that he was not showering money. And it was only paying money to the artist who had performed a cultural event during the party campaign. But however, taking note of that video that went viral, a non-cognizable offense that has now been registered against the Congress president, as he was seen showering money a day before the Election Commission announced the Karnataka Assembly election schedule. Let me go across to Imran now. Imran, DK is now having been booked by police. What does it mean? Well, this is a cognizable, non-cognizable offense. And because during a rally in Mandya, he had thrown cash from the top of his bus. And after that, BJP had taken umbrage, saying that Congress is trying to bribe the voters there in the constituency. A complaint was filed. Upon legal inspection, now a fire has been registered by the Mandya police. DK Shivakumar is under Section 171(e). That's a bribery case. Now, there are further investigations will happen. DK Shivakumar will be questioned about it. The video evidence is already there as proof of it. DK Shivakumar, however, in his defense, claims that he didn't throw the money. In fact, there were artists who were part of the rally. And he had given money from them. Since it was a rally, and he was top of the bus, he didn't have time to get down. And that's why he threw the money from the top. But this argument is not bought by the BJP. They said that it was to influence voters. And if it was for the artist's payment, that is, DK Shivakumar had disrespected them. All right. Please just stay on with us, Imran. Because as far as when DK Shivakumar was confronted and raised those questions, he had apparently defended his actions, saying he was only giving a small tip to the woman who had applied tilak on his forehead. And there were also cultural artists and performances as well, saying it was part of an Indian tradition. And he did nothing wrong. Let's listen into that conversation as well. There is a cultural festival mood where the cultural boys were there. And they were trying to do aarti to me. It is our Indian culture and tradition. My mother said, whoever do aarti, we are to give them a small tip. That is why the four or five of the cultural artists were there. I was just trying to-- because I was in a very high point. Then I just tried to pass on my note to the plate, whichever they had, which they were trying to give me aarti. That is why, due to the air, a lot of air, the four or five notes flew. Only 2,000 rupees I was trying to give to them, apart from nothing. So BJP and you people want to try to show us a very big way. I will welcome it. No problem. Let us face it. It is my culture. I'm not giving any freebie or any money to any voters. I know that. Well, with that development coming in right now, Imran, what does it mean for DK Shivakumar and the Congress party in whole? Because it was, I think, a next day later when the Model Code of Conduct was enforced. And this is coming at a time when the election dates have already been announced by the ECI. Well, absolutely. The Election Commission dates were announced. And the Code of Conduct is already in place. But even before that, there was-- police had a right to-- because the campaign rally and any kind of influence on bribing voters is an offense. Even before the Code of Conduct happened, we have seen that Karnataka had seized more than 4 crore rupees before the Election Commission announced the dates for trying to influence voters. And in this case, the party president, DK Shivakumar, had given a rally in Mandya. During this campaign rally, he had thrown money from the bus. He claims various defenses. But the BJP said it was to influence the voters. Now, a complaint has been registered at the Mandya. And FIR has been registered with the Mandya police. It's a non-cognizable print under 171(e). Now, DK Shivakumar will be investigated. He's found guilty. He will be fined for it. All right. Thanks very much for the moment, Imran, for joining in. So this is the latest and the biggest development that has now been coming in as the Congress leader who has now been booked, apparently, for throwing and sharring currency notes at the time when he was conducting a poll rally in Mandya in Karnataka."

 dear friends, today we have entered two stages of the election campaign against D.K. Shivkumar, who is the Congress candidate. Congress members have also put forward the allegation that they are doing illegal activities against the Indian people. In this regard, we have seen in the media that D.K. Shivkumar, who is a Kanakapura Shastra, has stopped some activities in his area of work, in the process of transporting the cows. But this has been put on the BJP side and they have put it all on their Facebook page. What they have done is, they have kept a pen and given it to the youth who want to make the country's future bright. To show how the BJP is controlling their future by taking up arms, the incident that took place yesterday at Satnur is a witness. The fact that the BJP is doing this, that they are giving weapons to the hands that have held the pen, is not right for D.K. Shivkumar. As a party leader, how right is it to give such disgusting statements? What is the benefit of this? By putting the youth on their lap, the BJP is a bad party. They are giving weapons to the youth who want to hold the pen and are ruining their lives. If you have done this with the intention of staying away from them, in the context of the election, if you have done this in the form of wrong ideas and bad opinions, whether it be the youth or the politicians, then this is a wrong idea along with the goodwill of our party. We have now taken a step towards the election. Another step is that D.K. Shivkumar has made another mistake. First, he said that the government is 40% without any evidence. Then, he made posters in the public to attract people and made us look bad. Today, he has created a meme app. If you go to Google and search for the meme app, ""I am unemployed, who cares about me?"" The fabricated result that appears on the Google search is ""Congress, we do, we do, we do, we do."" ""I am unemployed, who cares about me?"" The Congress says, ""We do, we do, we do."" And the BJP says, ""Sorry, no information, system failure."" This is a complete violation of the election rules. This is a violation of the election rules. We have given all the links and the CD along with the Google page. The Google page also has the message ""I am unemployed, who cares about me?"" The Congress has made it a message. They have said that they will take action on this. They have said that they will immediately book the FIR and remove the page. This will become a cyber crime. Yes, yes, it will come. Now you are going to the meme app. You and the youth there, they use it a lot. If you go to Google, it will come first. This is Congress. What Congress is doing is, ""I am unemployed."" It is here. If you type this in Google, it will come. ""Who cares about me?"" Then what will they say? Congress. See, it is written here. It is written like this. Congress. ""Leave, leave, leave."" We care about you. But they have created it. If you type in the name of BJP, ""Sorry, no information, system failure."" What it means is, We are not okay with them. Congress is the only one who is okay with you. This will become a cyber crime. They have done it with bad intentions. They have said that they will immediately take action on it. They have asked the Chief Minister. They are very advanced. Most of them have left our country and gone to Pakistan or Sri Lanka. They are not here now. Yes, yes. NEWS FIRST"

 The politics in Ramanagar is getting heated up Because now, DK Suresh is giving a speech to the big class DK Shukumar has accepted the death penalty The politics in Ramanagar is getting heated up DK Suresh is now protesting against Nikhil Kumar He is giving a speech to the high command class DK Shukumar has made it clear He has accepted the death penalty He has made it clear that the speech is there, no one can deny it He has made it clear that the speech should be given in a sitting The high command has sent a message The party is saying it But we have not decided yet The high command has sent a message The politicians have accepted it They do not want to do a re-election He has made it clear that he does not accept the death penalty But the high command has also said that it is accepting it On one hand, he has said that he does not accept the death penalty On the other hand, he has said that the party is saying it But we have not decided yet The speech is there, the politicians have accepted it But they do not want to do a re-election Because if DK Suresh is elected from Ramanagar The village will be empty again If the elections are held within 6 months, the elections will not be held But there will be a gap of one year So, elections will have to be held In that gap, we do not want to do a re-election in the village DK Suresh has said this But the high command has sent a message What is it? There is a proposal to contest against Nikhil Kumar Swamy in Ramanagar There is no delay They have said that the speech should be given in a sitting When will the speech be given in a sitting and the decision be taken? Will they really contest? What will happen if they contest? What will be the political struggle that will take place there? Till now, it was said that Ramanagar and Kanakapura will adjust for each other The same political adjustment politics was there But if DK Suresh says anything in a contest Will the adjustment politics break there? Will Kumar Swamy lose his temper in Kanakapura? We do not know There is a proposal, but I have not spoken in a sitting I have to speak to everyone I have a small message to give I have a message I have not spoken in a sitting or in a meeting It will be a major issue I will think about it So, who is behind all this to give a master stroke? This question comes naturally Siddharama gave a master stroke to DK brothers Siddharama gave a verdict that the free election should be held in Hale Mysore Congress should achieve what it has achieved by reducing the GDS Kumar Swamy should put a ban on his son and should not be adjusted Then, in Hale Mysore, it is possible for Congress to achieve more Siddharama said that if DK Suresh contested from Ramanagar, it is possible He gave a report that was secret to AICC But, he has now deleted the message DK brothers do not need any answer to AICC's proposal This is also interfering in the discussion In the election, how do the parties give weapons to the opponents? Similarly, the leaders of the parties are given weapons My brother, Sukesh is getting in touch with me directly from the political bureau Sukesh, this is the real fun in the election It is different to tie the opponent's party with weapons It is different to tie the leader of the party with weapons Ramanagar is very happy this time If DK Suresh contested in Ramanagar, what would JDS do in Kanakpur? In Ramanagar, there is a mutual understanding between DK Shukumar and HD Kumarswamy But, the fact that Congress is popular in Ramanagar or Chenpatna On the other hand, JDS is popular in Kanakpur All these are the words of the AICC's party Public TV and Bullet Rounds have also expressed their views They say that there is an understanding But, if you ask if there is a mutual understanding, there is no possibility to say it Because, they play political games In this situation, if the party should win more power What should be done in the old Mysore's Vakalagara Badrakote? A secret report was given by Siddaramaiah The public TV has also made a report In that report, there is a discussion about the contest of DK Suresh Now, DK Shukumar has told us We are thinking not to do by-elections Siddaramaiah's words and the high command's decision This is the internal discussion of Congress between DK Shukumar and Kumar Swamy The way to see the agreement is being discussed by Siddaramaiah against DK Shukumar All these are the questions and answers that are being asked Arun, can you say what will happen to the adjustment politics here? Arun, one thing is clear Even if there is a high demand for elections And, the JDS inquiry has been talking about the same But, the Shukumar's words are less So, when we see all this, there is a possibility that there is a conspiracy But, it is not possible to say that it is the same But, internally, Siddaramaiah's team had a suspicion So, how can we cut the JDS? How can we cut the JDS in the old Mysore? How will it be gained by Congress? Such a detailed discussion was given On one hand, if Kumar Swamy and his son Nikhil Kumar Swamy are against each other Then, they will be more interested in winning the JDS than in promoting the old Mysore This is also a reason for Congress to move forward On the other hand, if they are against the fight to destroy the old Mysore Then, how much will they get into the fight? Then, how much will Congress get? Such thoughts were presented in the discussion But, the part is for all these benefits But, what all might have been discussed in the AICC meeting Or, what all might have been said to DK brothers The AICC leaders, too, need to be examined In the coming days, what all might be the consequences of this It might be a source of inspiration for the directors Thank you Sukesh Nimela Mahithi It is not possible to remove it The proposal is there But, I will not sit and talk I have to talk to everyone I have a small message to give I have a small message Not that Message I have a small message I have not spoken to anyone I have not spoken to Suresh I have not spoken to our staff Everything else is our It will be a major decision I will think about it So, it is a major decision because Both are also people On one hand, Kumar Swamy and on the other, DK Shukumar They are called as the Shiodethu They are now in their own parties The question is If you ask DK Suresh in Ramanagar What will be the impact of that politics? Because, in Kanakapura, JDS will adjust But, what will happen? I don't know"

 we are ready, we want this government to be dismissed. The earlier the dismissal of this government, the better for the state and the country. Sir, what do you think about this election? I am also doing it for fun. What do you think that this election will be on the ideology or? This election will be a development oriented election. This election will be for a corruption free state and this election will be a model because the corruption is on the peak and Modi encouraged corruption and he did not open his mouth. He did not take any action on his party leaders and he has been promoting himself. Only for the sake of party he is compromising lot of corruption activities."

 Namaskara, Good morning, Shubhodaya, 30 minutes 30 news. Welcome to the show. I am Anu Navita. Let's take a look at the latest news with the latest developments. BJP's opposition party is in a heated debate. BJP has used their opposition party's votes to vote for the opposition party in the palace of Bengaluru. Today morning, the ballot boxes were opened in front of the palace of Nalinkumar Katti. There is a special plan to open the ballot boxes. The state committee has discussed and the state leaders have made a short list. The state leaders have held a court committee meeting with the district court committee members on ballot paper voting. BJP's state leader Nalinkumar Katti has been elected as the head of the court committee. The court committee leaders have been selected. A marathon meeting is being held in Kasagi resort, Harvaleda, Bengaluru. BJP's opposition party has held their last meeting. The Central Election Commission, which we spoke about in the morning, said that they will open the ballot boxes on April 6 or 7. But the ticket was given to Ramesh Charaki and he spoke out of turn. Now we have checked. There is no change in the ticket inquiry. We have also discussed about the preparation of the election and the association of the opposition. We are not a party of Congress and other parties. So we trust the people and give the ticket. We are not sure that it will be a vote of the left. People call the government as the decision maker. I believe that the government will be run by a party called Bharatiya Janta Party. Now the election announcement is there. BJP's CM B.S. Edhiyurappa has said that there is no problem in the elections. He has also said that he will contest the elections on the day of the hunt. I have said that there is no problem in the elections. I have said that there is no problem in the elections. I have said that there is no problem in the elections. BJP's ticket fight is increasing. BJP's ticket fight is increasing. BJP's ticket fight is increasing. BJP's ticket fight is increasing. BJP's ticket fight is increasing. We have fought for 15 years. We have fought and we have joined the party. We have worked in the district. We have done what the KPCC has given us. KPCC's president D.K.S. Kumar has held a meeting against the BJP government. He has been protesting since the beginning. He is still protesting. Congress has no objection. They are asking how can we give the ticket to BJP. Jeeva Sri Ramu, who spoke in Haveri, has said that D.K.S. is contacting the government out of fear of the election. They are doing the same thing. They are all desperate. They don't have the support of the BJP. They don't have the support of the BJP. They are asking for the ticket to BJP. It is not possible. This time, our government will give 100 crores. They are doing the same thing. They are all desperate. Congress has given the ticket to the Muslim for the Mata bank. Congress has said that the ticket was given out of the constitution. Our government has given the ticket to the Muslim and has given justice to everyone. Our government has given the ticket to the Hindu people. But, they have said that the wrong message has been sent to the people by the conspiracy of Congress. BJP was ahead of the Tamil Mathudar's campaign in Samaraj Nagar district. OBC meeting was held in Hanover. In the meeting, BJP's state representative Anna Malai gave a speech. If there are more Tamil Mathudars in Hanover, BJP is ahead of the Tamil Mathudar's campaign. When you vote, you should vote for the people who are against the BJP. BJP's ticket was stolen in the meeting of the opposition party. BJP's state representative Anna Malai gave a speech. He said that he will do everything. BJP's district president and district committee were attacked. The police have been released. BJP's opposition party's protest was held in Galate. BJP's ticket holder Chandrashekhar Gowda and his son Sidhanna Gowda were also there. MLC's Raghunath Rao Malkapare was also there. BJP's protest was held in Kolar. KGF's protest was also held. KGF's village officials were also there. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's protest was held in Kolar on 5th April. Satyamev Jayate protest was held on 9th April. Congress leader's meeting was held in Kolar's Nandini palace. KGF's state representative Maji CM Sidhramaiah and DK Shukumar were there. KGF's district committee's Balika and the first time Sidhramaiah has come to Kolar. Congress leaders met and held a meeting in Tamakabali. Congress leader's protest was held in Raichur. Halish Asuka's ticket holder is not getting a ticket. Congress leader's fight is going on. They are lobbying for a ticket. It is obvious that whoever gets the ticket will rebel. Congress is facing a lot of problems. We are the Congress party. Congress party never cheats. I feel that we should not cheat. We will not give up. I will stand for the party. There is a lot of work left. They have given a proposal. They will give."

 Ahead of the high stake state election in the state of Karnataka the man leading the Congress's campaign spoke exclusively with India Today In this interview DK Shiv Kumar who is also the state Congress President came down heavily on the Bharatiya Janata Party He even attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi just ahead of his visit to the pole bound state Shiv Kumar questioned why PM Narendra Modi did not visit the state of Karnataka during Covid and when the state was struggling with droughts Not just that he has also accused the Bami government of massive corruption He said that the Chief Minister is now grappling with the aftershocks of the MLA scandal that has erupted in the state DK Shiv Kumar has also expressed confidence that it will be the Congress that will win the state of Karnataka and he went ahead to claim that only the Grand Old Party can unite the country at the moment In Karnataka in the Bengaluru rural constituencies where you are travelling we heard one of your speeches and a lot of the people who were speaking before you were trying to prop you up as Chief Minister They were all talking about DK being Chief Minister Now Siddharth Amaya thinks he will be Chief Minister Varmeshwara once again thinks he will be Chief Minister Do you think this battle amongst the Congress leadership about who will be the next Chief Minister could be the biggest challenge for the Congress Party in this election? I am least bothered about who will be the Chief Minister People want definitely... they feel that they have their own choices But it is the Congress Party I commend My prime duty is to deliver a Congress Government The people, the workers, the common man should walk to the houses of the Vidhan Soudha telling that there is a Congress Government which has to govern them with a governance That is important. Not becoming me is not important The High Command will decide. Mr. Mallikarjan Karge and my party High Command Your biggest charge against the Karnataka Government is of corruption Pay CM, 40% CM etc. etc. Do you think this whole Virupakshappa incident has come as some kind of proof to your assertion? No, it is not only Virupakshappa Day 1, the suicide of Santosh Patel, the Contractor Association and Swamiji's MLAs of the ruling party, forget them Mr. Yathal, Mr. Vishwanath and one Mr. MLA from Chittor, Ex-Minister All of them came out on record that what is going on in the state, what more you need? Forget us, we are opposition. But you see, have you heard? On a OMR sheet, OMR sheet has been tampered An IPS officer in jail, more than 100 people are in jail On the youths, unemployment scam, PSI scam, police officer scam This is the biggest scam in every whatever department It is not only one department, in every department corruption is rampant Mr. Shivkumar, you are fighting a very important battle Because this is not just a battle for Karnataka This is a battle to prove that the Congress still has what it takes to win against the BJP If you win, it gives the Congress some hope If you don't, then it basically means that the game is over, khalas for the Congress Because if they can't win Karnataka, then basically you just pack up and go home You will have a surprise, you will have a change The change for the growth of this country, the change for the unity of this country The change is for the development of this country, the change for the youth of this country The BJP has the one thing you don't have, which is the magic of Modi They think that Prime Minister Modi can help overcome a lot of the anti-incumbency against the system Even Modi was there in Himachal, he was there in Delhi, he was there in West Bengal He was there in Tamil Nadu, he was there in Kerala His presence there in Telangana, he was there in Telangana You would have known that his rally made a big difference in the last campaign I don't think that will help you at all."

 D.K. has said that the victory lies in the campaign of the election in the field. D.K. has given a big thumb to D.K. who has said that the victory lies in going to the field. Kanakapura was a badra kote for JDS in the past. In the last election, it has changed from a badra kote to a good one. JDS was a bit confused in the JDS campaign. In 2028, D.K. has given a counter to JDS. My party was confused. Kanakapura has a lot of our campaign. Where did we face problems? In 2018, when the government was about to be formed, the decision taken by the state and the country in the political arena was a bit damaged in Kanakapura. Our campaign was a bit affected there. Today, a common campaigner has spent 60,000 rupees. Kanakapura is such a place. In 2028, with Kanakapura, we will have a place to stand for the people. from there i will go"

 CM has become a part of Congress, to create a gondola of Congress's moustache... Sir, there are three statements, one is that all the astrologers are in favour of Congress's presidency, the other is that CM is saying that he is a leftist and he will not blame anyone. See, even if you talk to a leftist, they will have a different opinion. I am saying this, I am also saying this as a party leader, this is not a state, this is a gondola in the state. The Supreme Court has given a judgement against the Supreme Court, and the two ministers have sat against it, saying that they have done it in the cabinet. Where is the backward class commission? The interim report that came in December, is there anything to be decided in the interim report? These should be given to the Constitutional Amendment. There may be an interim resolution or another, all that should be done with proper procedure. They have done a gimmick for the elections, some people have become a minority, what is the use of having a minority in this country? There is a big population in this country, we have been asked to give them, we have asked Swamiji, why did you ask Swamiji? Or did we ask? We had given a request, when we gave it to Ashok, that Ashok, after the population has increased by 12-15%, we will give a resolution. We have taken a 100% and given 4% extra, what extra have they given? How much is the support of our people, how much is the support of the people of Veerashawe? We both have done something special, this 56% has gone, give us more than that. Give it to both the communities. What was the 4% that they had? They should have kept it separately. What are you doing? You are giving food, the workers, the people of Veerashawe, we are all the people inside, the people who feed the society, we are the ones who give food, why are you troubling us? We are giving 2A, don't trouble them. 2A, the Hindus and the Raghupatis are here. 2% is not enough, sir. We do not agree to any reason, our government is coming after 40 days, I am not for them."

 PGR Sindhya is standing against Sachivar Ashok. When it comes to Padmanabhan Nagar, it was a fixing place. Congress used to ask money from him against Ashok. But this time, it seems to be a little different. Congress has decided to make the leader of the party against Ashok. PGR Sindhya is running from Padmanabhan Nagar. He has made a lot of decisions in the screening committee. PGR Sindhya has made Ashok a popular candidate. When Shiv Kumar Johli came to Padmanabhan Nagar, he was not just a candidate from Congress or any other party. He has spoken about his involvement in many parties. When Ramnagar came to Kanakpura, it was a well-known issue. Politicians would have understood it well. They would have said that he is not strong there and he is not strong here. Ashok always used to get cake from Padmanabhan Nagar. He used to say that he is not strong like any other candidate. But this time, Congress has gone to the extent of putting PGR Sindhya on Ashok and making him lose votes. Ramakant, as you said, when we look at Bengaluru, in some areas, there is unity. They have made agreements internally. They have a good relationship with the next-door government. They cooperate in their area and give strength in their area. The idea that they have made such good agreements is coming out of this IndiNinda. It is not just a coincidence. When we look at Padmanabhan Nagar, Ashok is winning there continuously. When we look at the reason for that, Ashok is the leader in the individualist community. On one hand, Devya Gowda's blessings are on Ashok. On the other hand, the Reddy community's followers are also there. So, Ramalinga Reddy's support is also on Ashok internally. Such rumours are coming out of IndiNinda. Similarly, when you look at the Bommaralli area, when you look at Satish Reddy's area, such things are coming out. Satish Reddy is winning because of Ramalinga Reddy's support. But, he is a dummy candidate from the Congress. He is not taking into account the popularity. So, what happens is, they will fix it. ""I am not coming to your area. You don't come to my area."" ""If you are in my area, you should give me support."" ""In your area, I will give you strength."" Such fake agreements are coming out of them. We have been hearing about it since last 40 years. So, the same government will come forward in these areas. As you said, such agreements are being made in Chanpattana Ramnagar. Now, they are talking outside the house. Here, they are making such agreements internally. We have struggled here, we have filed cases. We have run like this. But, when the election is near, they are making such agreements internally. They are making such agreements internally. So, what is happening this time is, the Congress has clearly announced that it will leave the AACC. But, Vijay R Sindhya, Shivu, Vijay R Sindhya, Vijay R Sindhya, they are in active politics. They are far away, or they are still active in active politics. Electoral politics. They are still active in the election politics. On one side, they are in Kanakpur. Now, they are in Padmanabhagra. They will change the party as it is. They will leave the party. They will join BSP someday. They will go to Uttarakhand. In one area, Sindhya should build a dam on one side. Sindhya is not doing that. How much Sindhya is active in Padmanabhagra, Ashok is in another place. He is in the town of Padmanabhagra. We cannot tell this to Sindhya. How strong can she be in the future? You are right. Because, PGR Sindhya and the other leaders, from the people's party to the Congress party, they have done a lot of work. They have done a lot of work. PGR Sindhya has done a lot of work. We can see that today. But, since the last few years, they are not active in active politics. There may be some meetings, scouts and guides. They are active in these. But, they are inactive in politics. They are not seen anywhere. We have been observing for the last 4-5 years. They are not seen anywhere. The reason for this is, PGR Sindhya should be counted from Padmanabhagra. The reason for this decision is, Ashok does not have any popularity. There are no strong contestants in Congress.

 What is the story of Belgavi BJP? The reason for the controversy is the BJP that is floating in the banks of Vandaya. Vandaya protestors are counting in 5 districts. The preparations are also going on to become Vandaya protestors if the ticket is missed. If Mahesh Kumteli misses the ticket, the Vandaya fix, the controversy is going on in Kanapura, Savadatti, Belgavi, Uttara, Vailahongala. The fear of becoming Vandaya protestors is rising in 5 districts. The BJP that is floating in the banks of Vandaya is being divided into 5 districts and the chances of it getting missed are being seen. Let's see the first one. If Mahesh Kumteli misses the ticket, the chances of it getting missed are high. The Vandaya protestors are worried about it. The people who trusted Ramesh Jharkhandi have come to the BJP ticket. Mahesh Kumteli is being seen as a terrorist. The people who trusted Ramesh Jharkhandi are being seen as a terrorist. But the people who are putting more effort to get the ticket than Lakshmana Saudi are showing insecurity. The third one is Kanapura. There are 3 candidates for the BJP ticket. Dr. Sonali Sonarabad, Vitthala Halgekar, Arvind Patil. The three of them are saying that they want the ticket. They are waiting in Kanapura. If they get the ticket, the Vandaya protestors are ready. Vitthala Halgekar or Arvind Patil. One of them can say that he is a Vandaya. For the BJP ticket, Basuraj Patanjali, Ratna Mamani are fighting for the ticket. There is a triangular fight here. Basuraj has warned that he will get the ticket if he gets it. For the BJP ticket, there are 3 candidates. Basuraj Patanjali, Ratna Mamani and Virupakshappa Mamani. The three of them are fighting. This is a topic discussed in the core committee meeting. In Belgavi Uttara, there is a fight between Shashika, Anil Benake and Murugendra Gowda. The Vandaya protestors are saying that they will give the ticket to the BJP. The Vandaya protestors have decided. In Belgavi North, there is a fierce fight between Shashika and Anil Benake. Murugendra Gowda is saying that he wants the ticket. He is saying that he is happy that Anil Benake got it. But if he gets it this time, he will definitely protest. In Kshetra, there is a fight between Baila Hongla and Jagdish Mettagudda. If Jagdish gets the ticket, he can protest. There is a fierce fight between the two for the ticket. If we see all these Kshetras, Our representative from Belgavi, Sahadev, will give us more information. Sahadev, if we see from the BJP's side, almost 90% of the seats are finalized in Belgavi. But the BJP has to stand against the opposition. There is a lot of complication in that. How is it possible to finalize the ticket in Belgavi? This is a big question for the BJP core committee. Yes, Ovinash, there are 18 different Kshetras in Belgavi district. To win more seats, the BJP has organized a lot of campaigns. To win 12-15 seats, they are planning. In this situation, 5 Kshetras are ready to give the ticket. Even if they don't give the ticket, they will be considered as a bandaya. Another one is getting fixed. In the case of Athini ticket, Ramesh Jarkuli and Lakshman Saudi have started a personal competition. Mahesh Kuntali has lost the ticket. But the opposition has started to criticize. The discussions have started. The other 4 Kshetras are also very strong. In Kanapur Kshetra, Dr. Sonali Sornabati is demanding for a female ticket. Vittal Halgekar and Arvind Patil are also running a lot of campaigns for the ticket. Even if one of them loses the ticket, the opposition will still be there to criticize. In that way, they are working in Kanapur Kshetra. If we see the other Kshetras, Anand Mamani's wife, Ratna Mamani and his brother Virupaksha Mamani are also demanding for the ticket. Even the ticket-holder Basavaraj Pattanchetty has lost the ticket once. But he has said that he will stand as a bandaya. In Bailungal Kshetra, there is a fierce competition. Last year, Jagadish Mettagudda lost the ticket. The opposition has lost the ticket to the bandaya. The BJP has lost the ticket to the Hinaya. This is the situation in Bailungal. This is the situation in Bailungal. In Belgavi Uttarakshetra, there is a fierce competition. On one hand, Murugendra Gowda Patil is demanding for the ticket. On the other hand, Anil Benke is demanding for the ticket. On one hand, Maratha and Lingayatris are demanding for the ticket. This is the situation in Bairangal. But there is a possibility that the ticket will be lost. This is the situation in Bairangal. These 5 places are demanding for the ticket. This is the situation in Bairangal. If there is any increase in the number of candidates, if the candidates are successful in the elections, if the candidates are selected as the candidates of the bandaya, it is very convenient for the Congress. The Congress has been discussing about this. If the candidates are selected as the candidates of the bandaya, the BJP is trying to silence them. But in these 5 places, BJP is leading. We will see how they will convince the BJP after the announcement of the ticket. Is it?"

Absolutely nothing wrong. Nothing wrong. If DK Shivakumar wants to become the Chief Minister, nothing wrong. If I want to become the Chief Minister, some ex wants to become the Chief Minister, nothing wrong. Ultimately, the newly elected MLAs, they have to elect the leader of the legislature party.

 I don't understand one thing, his brother's daughter is not growing up. The reason is she wants to become the CM. My brother wants to shave. My brother looks good when he shaves. I don't have that thought. For the past 30-40 days, suddenly he is in RR Nagar. He is not going anywhere. He is not here in the morning or evening. When I see his brother, he is roaming around the village. Give me a chance, make me the CM. Make me the CM. He goes everywhere. When I see him, my brother is not saying that he wants to become the CM. He wants to win RR Nagar. He wants to win RR Nagar. He is here in the morning.

A Muslim girl comes there. She comes to play with Sunanda Boregavada. After that, they go to their house in Maranasi. They go to the house of a Muslim girl. They give 50,000 rupees as a gift. Why? To break Sunanda Boregavada. Who is this person who is doing politics? To break Sunanda Boregavada. You are giving 50,000 rupees to a Muslim girl. Who is the person? You are teaching me politics. You are teaching politics on the basis of caste. You say, I will do this. I have done this. I have been an MP for 8-9 years in this constituency. What is your problem in Aranagar? Shall I come and see? Come, I will prepare for the election. Shall I call my middle friend? Let the people of this state know. Tell your gain and my gain. Let the people of this constituency decide.

You should put stones on the cars you have built. You should break the car of your minister. You should say that the car of the minister is broken. You should file an FIR on that. I know everything. I know all your schemes. Please leave this cheap politics. Go to the general assembly and do the religious assembly."

 In my constituency, in a small town called Sathoor, in the name of moral policing, in the event of moral policing, a murder has been committed against you. I am not going to react immediately to that. I am not going to talk to the police officers immediately. Because, until the complaint is filed against Bala Daisy, until the official complaint is filed, I am not going to talk about it. But immediately, our local leaders, our block congress, BJP, Shankar, all of them have attended immediately. Within two minutes, I and our MPs received a message. We immediately attended. The reason for this is, they have filed a complaint against someone, you all know, BJP, Bala Likir, all this is happening. In this case of moral policing, I am fixing the Chief Minister and Home Minister responsibly. They both are responsible. They themselves were encouraging the moral police to do this. So, I will go and check all the farmers. They are rich, they give money, they have a receipt, they are doing whatever they are doing. They can do whatever is done by the law. They have been killed by the government. So, the government is responsible. I have tweeted that the Chief Minister should be the one to take responsibility and the Home Minister should be the one to give the responsibility. So, I am doing it. So, in this way, in all our election time, a big system that is troubling our small population. Their life is there. They have the opportunity to do anything in their life. They are doing that. They are doing whatever they can. In this situation, they are creating a mess. This is a conspiracy. The Chief Ministers of the government, I am seeking the compensation of Rs. 25 lakhs and am sending it to the government. Whoever is involved in this, they should all come to the court. If you do not come, you should tell all your officers that you are protecting them. Because you all have a grudge against me. You have an affair with someone. For all that, you are giving compensation. You are protecting your leaders. That is what is seen here. For that, your activities, your faces, your food, whoever has committed this murder, has been killed. What should be done in the investigation? Who has committed this murder? I am the government. I know that."

 Hello, this is Network 18, and you are watching News 18. I am Nikhil Joshi. In the political arena, the leaders and parties have their own rules and regulations. The impact of these rules and regulations is on the upcoming elections. The elections are the bulletin for this Chathuranga game, along with the special discussion. Now, Chathuranga headlines. The time for the Vidan Sabha war is fixed. The result for the May 10th election is the real game has begun. The father's sacrifice, the son's request, the Go back, Gumma. The dissatisfaction in the Tumkur BJP against Somanna's son, has made the district chief to resign. After that, the love for others has been stopped. The BJP has been hit with the death ticket. Savadi, Jolle, Kadadi, Vaimanasu. The real Chathuranga game has begun. The election committee has announced the start of the game. The real game is on May 10th. The result for the 13th is the game. The time for the Kurukshetra election is fixed. The election is on May 10th. The result for the 13th is the game. The real game has begun. There are lessons to be learnt in this game. But the parties and leaders who are feeling the pain in this situation, how will they decide the rules of this game in the coming days? What will be their plans? The game is not limited to the party or the district. If the game is played outside the party, the game will start from today. Everyone has said that the announcement will be made on 28th or 29th. After that, they will leave the game. Congress, BJP, JDS have said this. The question is, who will leave the game and where will it go? It is in front of us. The election announcement was made on May 10th. In just one day, a single phase election. Let's discuss this in the election round table. Today, in the election round table, my colleagues Prithvi and Madhu are here. Welcome both of you. I will ask the first question. I will answer half of the question. Who will win the single phase election? In the current situation, the single phase election is not possible for Congress. It is difficult for BJP and JDS. Why? If the opposition is there, if Congress is there, then the single phase election will be over. Why is it difficult for BJP? We have seen the elections that have been held so far. Including Gujarat. In the first phase, the discussions will be held on the issues of the districts and districts. What were the issues there? According to that, the strategy of the second phase was to rework. Why is it difficult for JDS? There is only one star campaigner. If he is in the first phase, how many districts can he run? Now, he has covered more than 90 districts. When the election is on Saturday, there is a campaign to stop it. Its effect, its effect, that is different. What is the need for it? If you look at it completely, BJP was running the second phase and was doing the strategy. If you look at the BJP's campaign and political narrative, it seems that they do not have complete faith in the Karnataka election. Or they have a lot of faith. It can be said that they have a lot of faith. Because, no matter which state the election is held in, there is a corporate structure in the election. In the American presidential election, there is a wonderful campaigning strategy, and the attacking nature that is required. Here, I think they have come to a defensive mode more than an attacking mode. In the Karnataka BJP. Look, the opposition parties are proposing the BSY policy. But, they are not doing it. BSY will come to the house. BSY will stand next to them and do rallies. Or nothing has happened. No problem has happened. So, even if Sumnayya Bommai stands next to them and says that his leadership is strong, and if you consider someone as a guide or a coach and keep them away, it looks like a final match. On the other hand, the attacking mode is not reflected in the BJP's campaign. But, the BJP's attacking nature is not reflected in the first half of the election. Or before the announcement. They have been attacking in different states and in different situations. The question is, who has the weapons of attack mode? Exactly. Now, they can go to other states and do different kinds of rallies. They can do the protest. Now, look, here, there is not much to think about. Like Rani Abba, Jihad, Matantara Nishedha. Now, Mee Salathi has started. Mee Salathi has started. So, instead of having doubts about whether Mee Salathi will give or not, Mee Salathi has used the weapon in the last moment. They say double engine. They have only proposed the state government's policies. Exactly. Look, they are saying this because you have not proposed the state government's policies. In the first half of the election, BJP is showing a lot of nationalised approach in the campaign. It is seen as a Modi centred campaign. But, in this election, Congress has shown a little more public support than ever before. That is, the more locally we go, the more we can be able to touch a halfway mark. Now, if we take national or political issues, it will become a Modi centred campaign. The more we attack there, the more we will have the effect on the vote bank or on the opposition. You can say that we are not getting any solutions. In the 2018 election, when Sidhram Iran was in power, along with the UPA government's policies, they announced the benefits of the state. They are saying all that and asking for votes. But, when the High Command leaders came here, they said the Bengali Expressway, HAL, and other proposals. They are saying that the current BJP has been cursed with the same curses. This can come to anyone. That is a discussion that has been left to the public. But, if you look at the campaign's propaganda, BJP is showing a more of nationalised approach. They are the leaders of the state in that respect. And, even in the party elections, they have made a public statement. In some way, there are some big issues, the way the BJP is managing the Congress, I don't know what kind of terrorism is in the second party. But, in the first party, even in the front, there are some kind of opposition movements on the party. There may have been some small reflections. If you look at the situation in which they are managing that, it seems that there is still no clarity in the political, political or the political party's views. When you look at the BJP. BJP is still giving out the guarantee cards. They are attacking that. What are you giving out? There is still no clarity about that. There, the question is being asked. One minute. What do you know there? First of all, you should not ask what you are giving out. You should ask what you have done. Exactly. If you look at the three or four programs that the Prime Minister Modi has given out, he has given out the report card. Instead of saying that I did this and that, he has not spoken about anything else. The Karnataka government is also opposing that necessity. You are asking what you did in the front in the Pranayama. That is a different question. You have been in the government for three and a half years. The question is what you have done here. Exactly. If there is a threat or a question to the BJP, another thing is that there are many threats even politically. In all the units, I am not saying that there are 30 districts. In the parts that seem to be very important, Kittur Karnataka, Kalyana Karnataka, Hale Mysore, there are threats in the parties and in the units. It is being seen outside. What was the new tradition of BJP, Modi BJP? Ashisthu, Samyama, Samhite, there are many threats against that in the BJP. In other states, the BJP was looking at it from the opposition. They were laughing at it and laughing. They were doing the politics of encashing it. But it is not happening here. Another thing is that in the threat of BJP, the number of people coming to Congress is increasing. In that too, BJP, the RL party, the parties of the influence, the CM's parties may have been operated. The head of the party may have been released. If you look at all this, perception has been built there too. In other states, it was happening differently. All are like joining the sea. All leaders join the BJP. All rivers join the sea. That too has been reversed. How strong is Congress in our state, if you look at our state from another state, in the remaining 24 states, if any party is the leader, it is only for the Congress party. If you look at BJP, BJP is said to be a Kedar based party. Yes, it is the party of the leaders. But there are no leaders everywhere. And this election, the question of the destruction of political leaders, the question of the existence of the JDS, the question of the existence of the BJP, and the fact that Mallikarjuna Kargi's Thavaru Rajya has been removed, the Lok Sabha election was final. In this semi-final, the need for victory is there for both BJP and Congress. Because in South India, the political parties that have been firmly established, if you look at it, yesterday, in the form of the creation of a new quarter, BJP Kachari Adhuri Karanadhan, yesterday evening, Modi was talking. If any big party in this country, if there is a number one party in Karnataka, they say BJP. Is it because of this that the wave is going in a different direction, or is there any disturbance?

 We are getting some reactions. BJP spokesperson S Prakash is there with us on the phone line. Very good morning Mr. S Prakash. How do you react to this Congress cash chart? This is a rally in Karnataka and the Congress chief of Karnataka Pradesh is throwing notes over artists. It is a very irresponsible act by D.K. Shukumar, the KTTC president, insulting the currency also. Few months back a person who threw notes from the flyover was arrested and taken into police custody. Similar actions should follow even on D.K. Shukumar. There is a law to respect the currency notes. Throwing it brazenly over the artist is an insult to the artist also. The kind of campaign the Congress party is indulging in, they are displaying it by such behaviour. It is very unfortunate a responsible person is indulging in such an act."

 Why did the political accusation of friendship between the outside and inside go to the medical? After the BJP's political weapon against Rahul Gandhi was used, Rahul Gandhi's membership in Karnataka was reduced. What other measures should be taken? The news has come that the BJP's political and legal weapon has been used. The news has come that the BJP's political and legal weapon has been used. The Congress has not agreed to the case filed against Ravi. The MP's membership has been reduced during the Lok Sabha election. Rahul Gandhi was campaigning here. The party which has made the people against the people a home is not a party. The policy of the party is a congress policy. If the bomb is not destroyed, then Gujarat will not be able to do bulldozer strike in UP. CD Ravi is afraid of the soul. He has a mental problem. I have received the reports. I will do a survey on it. Let's put the ban on the loss of dignity. Those who have dignity will think about the loss. Those who do not have dignity will think about it. There is no face to ask for votes. There is nothing to do. I will challenge. Come and ask for votes in the political story that we have done in the time of their ruling. Rahul Gandhi has planned to have a big meeting in Kolar. The power that is in the hands of Rahul Gandhi is in our state. During the election campaign. Sukesh will give more details. Sukesh, I am asking you. In politics, tit for tat is very common. Is there no Congress to give the power that is in the hands of Rahul Gandhi to BJP? Is there no Congress to give the power that is in the hands of C.T. Ravi? Not only C.T. Ravi. There are many other powers. During the election campaign, it is common to make accusations. But in this case, if you have done medical treatment, then you have to use the law against it. Rahul Gandhi's speech on the political or election campaign was a reason for his strength in the organization. It is also a strength in the Karnataka. So, in the Karnataka, in the way of countering the BJP leaders, they should be captured. It is important to remember the mistakes that BJP leaders can do. But many times, even the Congress leaders are asking the state Congress leaders to do medical treatment. If you take the example of C.T. Ravi, D.K. Shukumar only talks about his mental illness and his speech against C.T. Ravi. But he only says that he will think about the law and make a decision. He did not say confidently that we will fight. So, it seems that the state Congress leaders have thought that it is right to take the political issues and accusations to the law. So, it seems that Rahul Gandhi's counter speech is not a simple speech of the Congress."

 For the Congress of Karnataka and for the history of the country's politics, Dhruvanarayan's public service and politics are a history. We spoke yesterday about Dhruvanarayan. We spoke about Dhruvanarayan who read Dhruvanarayan's one vote for a different party. That is not true. It is not permanent. I have a doctor who is my relative. I wake up at 3 in the morning. He called my home and informed me. He said that someone has come and is in the hospital. He has a blood vomit and has taken his last breath. He has given a new life to death and birth. He has given so much responsibility and so much respect to the people. He has played so many games with the mind of the people. He has given so much responsibility to the Congress family. He is a man who is more than that. He is a man who knows the importance of humanity, love and friendship. He is a man who is loved by all the people and all the religions. He has given me peace for 16 times despite all the difficulties. He has done his work as my employer. He is a great power and asset to me. I have to say this in one word. He is not my employer. He is a great asset to my family and the state. He has done his work in the area. He has taken responsibility for the change in the area. He is a witness to that. He is not with us today. I have called the ACC chairman, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi from abroad. I have called them all. I cannot believe that he is not with us. I cannot believe it myself. He is a man who has won our hearts. He is my friend and my brother. We have all met today. I do not know what to say. We have met at 11 o'clock in the Congress concert. I have called the people of Ramnagar district. I have called DK Suresh. I have told him what to do. He is a family member and my employer. I have given him the order to do everything. I have told his family today. I have given them some advice. I have told them that we should do the work of the government in the evening. He has told his family that we will sit and discuss. I have told my opinion to everyone. I have told everyone. They will decide when to give the last order. They have informed me. The family members will talk. The district minister has also called me. He has told me what to do and what to do for the government. There is a loss. I cannot bear that loss. I cannot bear the loss of his work, his friends, and the people who are there. I have told him that we will leave the house. We will stay for a few more months. I am very much worried. The health that he has done in the midst of this Covid. He has done the travel of the state. He has organized our party. He has taken the responsibility of saving the lives of the people. It is not possible to forget that. The hard work that he has done in the absence of oxygen. That is a virtue. That virtue of being in the house. We are going to make history. I am not as cruel as God. I have no doubt that God is above God. I have no doubt. My sister's health is also not good. I do not know how to stop this shock. I do not know how to stop it. God is above God. I pray to God to give strength to all the families and families. I am in God. I am not anything. I am not God. I do not have that fate. The property of our country, our culture. Our bond, friendship, love. He said that he would be with us forever. In this thought, his family will tell him when the last ritual of the journey will be. I cannot say what I have spoken. They should tell. Now we are holding the congress concert at 11 o'clock. I and my people are with you. Today I am not walking. I was in Ramnagar district. I am not walking. In the afternoon and evening, I will be in Chamnagar district, Mandya district. Everyone is calling me and talking to me. I am not able to talk to Siddharma. I will talk to everyone and decide the meeting at noon or evening. I will finish the final congress concert and go to Mysore. NEWS FIRST. Every moment, for you."

 So it more or less has come down to an ego battle for the BJP and a survival battle for the Congress party. You know, Nagarjun, to you on that, we know that the Congress in Karnataka, in compared to several other states, they are only in power right now in Chhattisgarh, Himachal, so Karnataka is really important for them. But in compared to the other states, Karnataka, they have a really strong grassroot level cadre. They have mass leaders like DK Shivkumar and Sidh Ramya, which somehow we see that the BJP lack. Even though BSC Adi Rappa is also known to be a mass leader, he is somehow now in the margins, not really out there and in the grind. We have heard a lot of reports within the BJP itself, how there are cracks and many of them working against BSC Adi Rappa in the state, etc. But for the Congress here, we believe with their mass leader, they are trying to gain their support, but yet somehow defections is something that they struggle with. They weren't able to contain it in 2018 when they came to power, many of their leaders jumped to the BJP. This time around, what's the pattern that you see? What's DK Shivkumar's magic formula? If at all they are even near to being a single largest party, how are they going to contain their leaders from moving over, switching to the BJP, etc. We already know that some of them from the BJP have come this side, defections altogether. Do you think this can be contained this time around? That's post-election scenario, Nabila, but what is happening, the run-up to the elections in the last one month is Operation Hasta or Operation Hand is happening in Karnataka. Two sitting MLAs from the BJP have moved. Just yesterday we are picking up that one sitting MLA of the BJP met Mr. Surjewala and DK Shivkumar. So it's a reverse engineering is happening, reverse operation is happening, at least free pull. Depending on what happens next, we'll have to wait and watch. But the Congress, what they are saying, this time they'll make sure that they'll put an end to resort politics, their MLAs will not be poached and also largely it's because the candidates that they are choosing is from merit-based and are truly loyal to the party, who are truly loyal to the ideology of the party. The first-time MLAs are the ones who have been told specifically that watch out, you can't move if you win to BJP, we will make sure that we'll fight cases against you, fight in the court of law. All these consequences they have been told and also the data that they have picked from the surveys clearly shows that these candidates have been loyal to the party, they have had chances to move to BJP-JDS but they have always stuck with the party at the lowest level is also their field. And hence they have been rewarded with tickets and there is no doubt that the Congress MLAs will go to BJP or JDS is what the Congress is feeling. But that's a larger question to see after the verdict. But at this point of time it's a reverse engineering happening. Just the Chief Minister yesterday, we heard him say that DK Shivkumar has been calling all his MLAs in BJP saying, please come to us, we will give you tickets. So right now the Congress is doing reverse poaching of called Operation Hasta in Canada or Operation Hand that they are trying to poach sitting MLAs of the BJP. Mr. Puttana who was a BJP MLC was poached, he has been given Congress ticket in the first place. So many such examples would happen in the next few days because Congress' 100th seats is still pending. We'll see a lot of BJP faces in Congress now. Alright, alright. Stay with us Nagarjun. I'm going to cut across to Chief Minister Basaraj Bommai who in a buzz has spoken to India today right after the Election Commission's announcement. Just about an hour from now EC is going to announce when Karnataka will go into polls. Basaraj Bommai, the Chief Minister speaks. Do you think that it will be announced today or tomorrow? Yeah, yeah, as per anticipation. Congress has already released the first list, sir. When is the BJP list going to be released? Probably after a week or so, when the first list will be released. If you notice the reservation announcement which has been made by your government, now there are a lot of protests which is happening across the city. Do you think it will backfire? Congress is trying to create some confusion in Banjara community only. And we have talked to all Banjara leaders, our MLAs have talked. There is no issue. Everything will be set right. All the national leaders will be coming for campaign in Saffron? Yeah, yeah, all the national leaders including Prime Minister, Amit Shah, Jay, Nadda, Jay, everybody will be there. Thank you so much. Yogi Adityanath will also come. Yogi Adityanath."

 Congress's India-Jodo Yatra in Karnataka got a good response. And now, the state's President, D.K. Shivkumar, is waiting for a big news from Congress. Congress's own survey on the state shows that the party can get more than 140 seats out of 224 seats in the upcoming election. Shivkumar has actually made this claim in reference to a survey. On Wednesday, the President of Congress, while talking to the media in Bangalore, said that ""We have a guarantee of our number. We also have a guarantee that BJP's seats won't go more than 65. Let BJP do what they want to do, but their number won't go beyond 60-65."" He said, ""This is for sure. But according to me, it won't be surprising if their number decreases to 40."" In our previous survey, the number of seats was estimated to be 176. And now, our survey is estimating that it will be more than 140 seats. The changes have begun. We are seeing this happening in the entire state. There are about 50 days left for the elections, but it is getting late. The reason for this is that the BJP thinks that the more days they get, the more beneficial it will be for them. That's why they are trying this way. Actually, D.K. Shivkumar has even said that some other BJP MLAs will also join the party. And they are continuously talking to them. But for now, they won't disclose anyone's name. BJP leaders are joining the party without any conditions. They are also accepting the ideology and leadership of the party. Shivkumar also claimed that the BJP wanted to hold elections in Karnataka right after the Gujarat elections in 2022. And they also talked to the officials. But they backed out later. Let me tell you that there is a possibility of elections in the state in May. Before that, in the 2018 Vidhan Sabha elections, the BJP won 104 seats in the Vidhan Sabha with 224 seats. And it rose as the biggest party. While Congress got 80 seats and JDS got 37 seats. However, in later days, BJP got a majority in Vidhan Sabha because many of the MLAs of Congress and JDS joined Bhagwa Party. Namaskar! I am Manak Gupta.

 BJP has become an enemy and a friend of the party. They have left the party after the reservation. They have been defeated in the last election. BJP has taken the power and joined the party. They have made the committee of the committee. They have made the chairman. They have made the chairman of India New Delhi. They have made the government. I don't want all this.

There is a lot of controversy. There is a lot of book, a lot of glasses, a lot of things. But no one has shown it. In the future, in Hyderabad and Karnataka, Malik Arjun Kargi will win. Today, in 2023, I will show what Baburao Chinchanchuru's power and strength is. Baburao Chinchanchuru scolded Malik Arjun Kargi and got angry. It is a father-son fight. You should not call your son and daughter-in-law as your son. It is a father-son fight. It is all right now. If you had slapped him, he would have said that he would have slapped Malik Arjun Kargi. You have ruined the lives of 6.5 crore people in the case of Malik Arjun Kargi and DK Shivkumar. You are a liberal politician. You have come here to give a speech. I am a liberal politician. I have no rights. I have no mother, father, children. I have served the people for 30-35 years. I have worked for the party. Today, the party has 100 members. In the future, you all should know Baburao Chinchanchuru's power and strength. You should not say anything about DK Shivkumar. You should not say anything about DK Shivkumar. You should not say anything about the 7 people who have served me. BJP has been terminated in Chitrakoot. BJP has been terminated in Chitrakoot.

 Namaskara! You are watching Ashwagah! I am Balagha! Government offices and houses are our property. Government offices are not just a property. Every person who works in a government office, should keep his office clean and tidy. Every government office is a part of the society. Every government building is a part of the society. There are tobacco packets, cigarettes, oil bottles, and even the tobacco in the compound is a part of the society. Government offices are not just a government office. Why should we keep them clean? We should keep them clean. The public comes here and gives us salary. We should keep them clean. Why should we do that? Because you should get government jobs, government offices, government facilities, and then you can get money. Government offices are like a public place. What do you want from it? You should not go out of it. Is this how you keep your government offices? Is this how you keep your government offices? If you keep the government offices like this, your office will be full of dust. The tables, chairs, and the office chambers will be full of dust. The office will be full of dust. Why? Because they don't maintain it. They don't pay attention to the maintenance. In the NH44, the Chennai highway, the Chandapura subdivision, the gate that was empty, the compound that was empty, the dust, bottles, oil, and leaves on the compound, if you go a little further, the chair that was built recently, the two tiles on the left side, if you go a little further, on the right and left, the beer bottles, pickle packets, oil bottles, tomato trays, the commode that is used in the bathroom, the flush tank is out, the pipes are out, the things that are supposed to be kept there are not there. The things that are supposed to be kept there are there. There is no bathroom downstairs. What is the space around the office? Two feet, two feet, two feet. It is full of dust. The small windows that are not used for work are there. If you go to the first floor from there, if a public comes, there is no place to sit. The three people are sitting together. Where should a person who has come to work sit? In the construction section, in the technical section, in the AW chamber, if a person with a problem or a patient comes to the office, there is no toilet to urinate. They have put a beak for that. They have spent lakhs of rupees, they have spent crores of rupees and have built an EV charging station. The EV charging station, till date, has not cost even 10 rupees. Since the construction of Sarvajanikara, EV charging stations have been developed. But till date, it has not cost even 10 rupees. There are 3 EV charging stations. They are being built daily. Who is not there? Sarvajanikara's own money is spent. That is the truth. Sarvajanikara's own money is spent on building. Sarvajanikara's own money is spent on EV charging stations. But, the construction of that building, the construction of that building, has not been done by any official. The construction of the Chandapura department, the construction of the Chandapura department, has been completed. There is no construction. It has become a new sign. Today, this sir, Lokesh has come. A.W. Ashok has also come. If he had come, wherever you go, the concert is the same. Why should you maintain the concert? D.T. sir, you should give instructions to the officials. Please. Because, Sarvajanikara, today, wherever you go, he goes to the mobile night. If you shoot and if you upload something on Facebook, Twitter, or any other platform, the respect will go. It will be a shame. D.T. sir, please give instructions to the officials. The government concert should not be a new sign. It should be clean. In the social gatherings, in what way, in what way, the people should be aware. Our best community is not going to international level, internationally. There is nothing like that. Cleanliness is not something that can be achieved by saying. We should do cleanliness. House, land, vehicle, everyone should be clean. Government, the officials, should be clean. I wish you all to be clean. I am finishing this one episode. Till here, you have seen Ashwagandha. I am Balagha. Namaskara."

 So thank you for waiting for all of us. You know we all will be in an election committee meeting. I think more or less 60-70% we have all unanimously decided. And rest we will take some time to discuss the other issue. As rightly said, our aim is only to bring Congress Party to power and we will deliver. We will deliver a good government, a government with a governance. We will see that the most corrupt state which has been already given a boon from the BJP will be vanished. I am very happy that all of you are also waiting to have a good beginning at the South India and Congress Party will come to power. We all stand together, we work together, we will bring Congress Party together. I am not upset with anyone. I know what Sidhra Maya Heart is, I know what my heart is, I know what your heart is. We all will win. Our aim is to bring Congress Party and you all have to walk and meet us at Vidhan Sodha. So our heart is clear and so should all of you be. Thank you. News first. Channa."

 In the same program, Sidharamaiah was invited to be a part of the program. It was a program to make Gopi Srinivas a candidate. In the process of getting Gopi Srinivas to be a candidate, many interviews are ending with the question of whether Sidharamaiah will be a candidate. Because, first, D.K. Shivakumar calls Sidharamaiah and asks him to come and give the vote to Gopi Srinivas. He says this with a doubt. But, when Sidharamaiah is standing and raising his hand for the vote, he himself directly gives the vote to Gopi Srinivas. We can clearly see those scenes. D.K. Shivakumar calls Sidharamaiah and asks him to come and give the vote to Gopi Srinivas. Sidharamaiah is standing and raising his hand for the vote. We can also see another scene in the screen. We can see the chair in which D.K. Shivakumar was sitting. In the Congress party, there was a fight between D.K. Shivakumar and Sidharamaiah. Recently, Rahul Gandhi came and asked the Cardinal to come. The state noticed that there was a fight between them. Today, there is an interesting interview. D.K. Shivakumar and Sidharamaiah were there to ask for the vote. We can see that in today's competition. 'SFIRST' Every second, forever."

11711a83ff6eea2bb160e04de030f680cc2c44f0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9i_1GjDyqo,Times Of India,'BJP offered me Deputy CM post' claims Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivakumar #karnatakaelections,"The Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivakumar has intensified the ""Battle for Karnataka"" ahead of the state assembly election. Shivakumar spoke to the media about the Congress' strategy for the upcoming election, in which the party hopes to regain control of the state.

Shivakumar stated that during the last election, the Congress fought under collective leadership, and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah led them. He added that the BJP's quota and reservation agenda is a political strategy and accused the ruling party of trying to divide the people of the state on the basis of caste and religion.

Shivakumar also took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stating that he is fostering corruption in the country. He said that the major goal of the state Assembly election is to guarantee that Congress obtains control of the state and that the party is confident of winning the election.

In addition, Shivakumar revealed that the BJP had approached him and offered him the position of Deputy Chief Minister if he left the Congress. However, he said that he had turned down the offer and that he was committed to the Congress party.

The upcoming Karnataka Assembly election is seen as crucial for both the Congress and the BJP. The Congress is hoping to regain control of the state, while the BJP is looking to hold on to power. The BJP has been campaigning aggressively in the state, with senior leaders like Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath holding rallies and addressing the public. The party has been highlighting its achievements in the state and its efforts to improve the lives of the people.

On the other hand, the Congress has been focusing on issues like unemployment, farmers' distress, and the state's deteriorating infrastructure. The party has been critical of the BJP's policies and has accused the ruling party of neglecting the needs of the people.

In conclusion, the ""Battle for Karnataka"" is heating up as the state assembly election approaches. The Congress and the BJP are both vying for control of the state, and the election is expected to be closely contested. With political heavyweights from both parties campaigning extensively, the election is likely to be one of the most significant state polls in recent times.

 I don't know why media is portraying all the climax. Rahul Gandhi and the Congress President, Mr. Malik Ajin Karageji, has made it very clear. This is an election on collective leadership. So we are running the election on a collective leadership. Earlier, we had gone through Mr. Sidramaiah in the last assembly election. But ultimately, we could not succeed. So they brought me as the president when Mr. Sidramaiah resigned as the leader of the opposition. And Mr. Dinesh Gundrao resigned as the party president. Srimati Sonia Gandhi appointed me as the president in the worst time of the Karnataka politics. From that day to day, I think you all are speaking on the chief minister's post. That means the Congress party is coming to power. So I'm very happy you all have confidence that Congress will come to power. Well, I don't know, sir. Let's see. But has there been some sort of understanding with Mr. Sidramaiah, if this is collective leadership, that the Congress is working with? Is there some sort of understanding? Forget the infighting. If and when the time comes to appoint a chief minister, we'll just split it. We'll do two years and two years or two and a half years and two and a half years. No such understanding has been taking place. We are on a collective leadership. We'll fight together. We are joined together. Our duty is to see that Congress party comes to power. And we will give a very effective government with a governance. You're saying your full concentration right now will be for the Congress party to come to power. But your opposition is a mighty opposition with many, many hands and many more resources than you have. What's your plan? What's the Congress's plan? We do not match them with any resources or their master plan or master strategy. But our resources is the strength of the people. Whatever the double-engine government was there, whatever the mighty government was there, we are able to prove to the state, we are able to prove to the voters that this engine has failed. And no more they can't keep up the image what Karnataka has. Karnataka is a state where we had a very big image. The country had-- the entire world used to look at India and India through Bangalore and Karnataka. Now that has gone. It has become the corruption capital of this country. A country that has lost its image through Karnataka, we have to somehow restore the glory of Karnataka and Bangalore. But you know, the counterflip side to that argument, Mr. Shivakumar, is the fact that you yourself have corruption charges against you. The prime minister on multiple occasions has stepped out and said, this is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] The entire effort to save Rahul Gandhi is all [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] is all opposition parties who are corrupt are coming together to launch this [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] My chair, the prime minister and the chief minister were asking for a witness. The LOKA Act has given a witness. The contract associate president, Mr. Kepana, who has two and a half lakh members in it, has officially said on record with you and the entire state that without 40%, there is no commission. When we said that we pay CM, they could not reply. They was asking for an evidence. The LOKA Act has given an evidence. What more do you need? So they wanted to cover up. They are just trying to bring things emotionally on caste, on division, on a lot of polarization thing. But people are fed up with this. People have decided to root out Karnataka, root out the BJP in Karnataka. See, on May 10th is not the day of election. It is the day which they are going to root out Karnataka, root out corruption in Karnataka. For a good governance in Karnataka, for a change of state and the party in Karnataka. So it is a very important day. It is not only the election day. We are going to see that Karnataka will have a change with a good administrative government. Whatever we have promised, we will fulfill. Mr. Shivakumar, but then the charge is going to be, how can the Congress and Mr. Shivakumar talk about corruption when the ED is after him, when there are charges of money laundering against him? I agree. They planted a story. They planted a case against me when Mr. Amit Patel's election was there. They sent me. They raided me. They have fixed a false case, a political case, which has been-- they wanted to tarnish me. They want to pressurize me. I did not yield to them. I had to stand loyalty to my party, whatever the direction my party had given me that day to save the MLAs in Karnataka. I do that at that point of time. They raided and they filed a case. I'm fighting out. I believe in the law of this country. Justice will prevail upon me. All the opposition, they're not teaching any single opponent parties. Only they're using this ED, income tax, whatever is there. Today morning, I was speaking to one of my--"

 Karnataka Congress Chief DK Shivakumar lands in trouble for throwing notes at a rally. DK Shivakumar was caught on camera throwing notes from his tour bus during a rally in Mandya on Tuesday. BJP condemned the incident and has launched a corruption jibe against DK Shivakumar. Karnataka Chief Minister Bommai says Shivakumar blatantly misused power and the people of Karnataka would reject him and the Congress party. However, Shivakumar defended the action saying he was giving money to artists who had travelled for the event. He hit back at BJP saying they should first answer on the 40% commission charge. ""See he does everything. He blatantly misuses all kinds of powers and he does everything and he blames us. That has been his. He is like that. People know. That's why they are going to reject him."" ""Shivakumar is following the big leaders of the Congress in corruption. I am not surprised about this. The party is corrupt and Shivakumar is corrupt."" ""You showering money at that point of time. The BJP is saying this is you trying to buy out the voter in Karnataka, sir."" ""I did not shower any money. There were artists that came all the way. I just gave them 2000 rupees. I think I was in a very top place. I just tried to drop the vote that was being showered. That's all. Nothing. I was not buying money. I was not giving. There were the artists who have been doing this. So a lot of artists were there. I just gave them 2000 rupees. What is that? What is wrong in it? I was in the top of the list."" ""The BJP of course is alleging right now, sir, that you are the moneybags. You are considered to be the moneybags of Karnataka Congress and money is going to flow in these elections because of the Congress."" ""The entire country knows who is the moneybag, where they bought, where the money was, how much they have got donations, how much they have got bonds."" ""Mr. Amit Malviya of the BJP is over the phone line. Mr. Malviya, would you like to respond? He was only showering money on the artists over there."" ""Well, the fact is that he has been caught on camera throwing wads of 500 rupee notes. And if he was giving it to the artists as he's claiming, this is not the way you treat artists. This is even worse than saying that you were trying to buy votes. You're throwing money at artists. These are people who earn honest living. They don't need ill-gotten wealth from the Congress and Mr. Shivkumar to be thrown from the bus rooftop. This is insulting the people of Karnataka. And I repeat again, this is corruption money. He's trying to buy out votes. He's looting the air. He has looted the state while they were in power. This is ill-gotten wealth. He's under several investigations by the agencies. And clearly the money is being used to swing Karnataka elections in Congress' favor. But that will not happen because people will vote for development, for the big highways, for the airports, for the expressways, for the fueling projects."" ""Okay, those serious charges you're making, Mr. Malviya. Mr. Shivkumar, will you respond to that? This is ill-gotten wealth, is what the BJP is saying."" ""I don't want to respond to this 40% commission fellows. They are 40%. They have looted the state. Double engines are cars. They are the most corrupt capital of this country. The people will throw them out, throw them out, throw them out."" ""Okay, the people will throw you out, Mr. Malviya, is what Mr. Shivkumar is saying."" ""Throw BJP out. Throw BJP out. I don't want to respond to this."" ""Well, right now, it is quite clear that who has looted the state and who is throwing money at people and insulting the people of Karnataka, insulting the artists of Karnataka, insulting the hard-working people of Karnataka who want development, who want a progressive government at the centre. And Mr. Shivkumar and Mr. Bumai and his gang will know very soon what the people's verdict is going to be."" ""Mr. Shivkumar, the CM has made a very serious allegation as well that you are poaching away BJP MLAs because Congress doesn't have enough good candidates, Mr. Shivkumar. That's the CM's allegation. You're poaching their MLAs. You're poaching MLAs is what Mr. Bumai is saying because Congress doesn't have good enough candidates."" ""BJP MLAs are coming to our doorstep. They want to join the BJP. Join us. They feel that they will not win back in BJP. That is why all MLAs are coming to us. It shows that BJP is on the losing ground. I think they have not crossed more than 56 cities and it will be rooted out in Karnataka."" ""Mr. Malviya, your MLAs are just walking over to the Congress?"" ""No, people who know that they will not get tickets from the BJP are rushing to the Congress and the Congress, sure of not being able to find candidates, is announcing their list even before the BJP is doing so. The losing party is the one which usually announces candidates first. That is the simple rule of politics. And the ones who are going to be on the winning side wait for the winning party to announce their candidates much later. I think anybody who watches politics will tell you that the Congress is desperate. They know they will not even get candidates after BJP announces its list. That is why they are rushing into announcing their candidates and their list. And secondly, I want to know which candidate is Mr. Siddharamaiah's candidate, which candidate is Mr. Shivkumar's candidate, which candidate is Mr. BK Hariprasad's candidate, because the Congress is so fractured that if they were ever to get anywhere close to power, they will not be able to decide who the chief minister is and then they will start stealing from the state. Before the candidates, please let the Congress announce who their chief ministerial candidate is. Is it Mr. Shivkumar, who is spending all his ill-gotten wealth, or is it Mr. Siddharamaiah? They should first make up their mind on that first big issue. Okay, who is the... First you send your house order, your house, the broken house, Yedurappa and Sir Fasunaj Bombay. There is a lot of difference. You are just harassing them. You are harassing Sir Yedurappa. You just threw him out, unsurprisingly. You are just dividing the caste. You are dividing the community. You are working against the constitution. You should know there is a slap on your face. The people who support you, they are the ones who are going to be on the winning side. And the people who are going to be on the losing side, they are the ones who are going to be on the losing side. Okay, thank you. Thank you. The BJP has a sitting chief minister and we are completely confident that he is the winner. The first thing you are... I ask again, who is the chief minister of Congress in Karnataka? Is it Mr. DK Shivkumar, who is sitting in the house? Is it Mr. Siddharamaiah? Is it Mr. Shivkumar? Is it Mr. Shivkumar? Is it Mr. Shivkumar? Is it Mr. Shivkumar? Is it Mr. Shivkumar? Is it Mr. Shivkumar? Is it Mr. Shivkumar? Is it Mr. Shivkumar? Is it Mr. Shivkumar? Is it Mr. Shivkumar? Is it Mr. Shivkumar? Is it Mr. Shivkumar? Who is the chief minister of Congress in Karnataka? Is it Mr. DK Shivkumar, who is spending all the money? Or is it Mr. Siddharamaiah? That is the answer that the Congress is not willing to give."

 Hello viewers, this is Karnataka TV For the past 6 months, we have been giving a political survey We have been giving a mega survey It started in October Now, we will give you the political trend of March We will give you the list of 824 constituencies No logic is needed This is the list of the constituencies to be mentioned We have given it in detail But still, BJP has not done well in the list of candidates When the nomination started After the publication of our letter The candidate was released in 1, 2, 3 such boxes If we give too many setting emails, it may get missed by 6-7 people What else? What else? The list of 824 constituencies We have given it in March October, November, December, January, February It is a discussion of the state politics Because, which list? No logic is needed Karnataka TV says something We have to keep our faith That is what we are doing The trend has changed People have seen the trend change every month Now, March has come Election is near March trend There may be some changes There may be some differences All these will be there We do not know in this final After the list of candidates is announced There may be some changes But, what was the trend in March We will keep it in front of you This is the trend of March month Because, the trend changes every 15 days After the election announcement, some constituencies will change once a day There will be one in the morning and one in the afternoon After the election announcement Some constituencies, all constituencies So, we will start from Belgavi district In Belgavi district, 8 constituencies will be there In those 8 constituencies Who will run? Ramesh Jaraki Oli will give a good example to BJP If he is a rebel, then his power will be understood I have spoken to him What is the story? First of all, the first constituency is Nippani constituency Sashikala Jolle's constituency BJP will contest Congress, Lakshman Rao Chingle, Kakasahe party If both of them do the election together Sashikala Jolle can give a tough fight Meanwhile, Ramesh Jaraki Oli's student Uttam Patil He too will contest here Independently It can be a symbol of JDS in some places But, the fight between BJP and Congress As I said earlier Lakshman Rao Chingle and Kakasahe party Both are united Kargesh Sishya and Sidhu Aap If both of them do the election together Sashikala Jolle can give a tough fight Tough fight On the other hand, it is not possible to hold big elections from here All will be united If all the Congress members unite There are talks that Ramesh Jaraki Oli will be the sole speaker And Sashikala Jolle will be the nominee BJP and BJP It is possible Because Uttam Patil has a student from Jainsamudakasya It is not possible here Uttam Patil cannot win It is not possible But, it is possible to disturb So, because of all these reasons Congress has united and did a good election It can give a tough fight But, it is not possible In the March month trend Sashikala Jolle BJP has taken the lead in Nippani constituency In the March mega survey of Karnataka TV If Ramesh Jarki Oli stands as a supporter of Uttam Patil BJP vote will be divided and Congress will get a positive result Even before this, votes were contested by Congress in Kaledabari BJP and the bank have a vote bank If they too contest and BJP is selected Sashikala Jolle will win in the next 10-20 years Even if Uttam Patil wins, Ramesh Jarki Oli will not favour Uttam Patil Because in Kaledabari election, everyone was opposite Sashikala Jolle was the only one who voted Sashikala Jolle is not a politician who can rule in anyone's land It can be a female politician She can run a business Sashikala Jolle has the capacity to rule on her own So, there will be no extra problems So, BJP has taken the lead in Nippani in the March survey of Karnataka TV Yes, in the next episode After the sitting of Congress, Ganesh Yukeri Ganesh Yukeri is connected to Congress BJP is connected to Mantesh Kautikeyam Along with Jagdish Kautikeyam and Amit Kaur So, there are 3 candidates So, there is a tough fight If they all get together and contest, it will be a fight for Ganesh Yukeri Here, the fight between Congress and BJP JDS is not that big In the fight between Congress and BJP There is a trend of March in Karnataka TV After the sitting, Ganesh Yukeri has taken the lead BJP has the final ticket If they all get together, it will be a fight If they all get together and contest, it will be a fight for Ganesh Yukeri If they all get together and contest, it will be a fight for Ganesh Yukeri If they all get together and contest, it will be a fight for Ganesh Yukeri If they all get together and contest, it will be a fight for Ganesh Yukeri If they all get together and contest, it will be a fight for Ganesh Yukeri If they all get together and contest, it will be a fight for Ganesh Yukeri If they all get together and contest, it will be a fight for Ganesh Yukeri If they all get together and contest, it will be a fight for Ganesh Yukeri If they all get together and contest, it will be a fight for Ganesh Yukeri If they all get together and contest, it will be a fight for Ganesh Yukeri If they all get together and contest, it will be a fight for Ganesh Yukeri We can't wait for the next contest.

As per the March survey, Nippani, Athani, Kagavada, Kudachi, Ukeri, Arbavi, Gokak, Belagavi Uttara, Belagavi Dakshina, Kanapura, Kittur, BJP is ahead. Congress is in the small states of Chikkodi, Sadalaga, Yamakana, Maradi, Rayabaga, Belagavi Gramena, Bailhongla, Savdathiyalam, Ramdurga. BJP is in the 11th state. Congress is in the 7th state. BJP is ahead in the March survey. I'll tell you what's written in the end. Lakshman Samadhi is saying... If Mahesh Kumar Tally misses one ticket, If Mahesh Kumar Tally misses one ticket, and Lakshman Samadhi gives the BJP ticket, and Lakshman Samadhi gives the BJP ticket, BJP's Gokak, Gokak, Arbavi, Gokak, Arbavi, both of them together... BJP won't be able to beat Athani. They are saying that BJP will be defeated. They are saying that BJP will be defeated. They won't be able to beat Athani. They will call Balchandra Jharki Oli and they will jump to JDS. Then they will call Srimanth Patil. In Srimanth Patil, Mahesh Kumar Tally, Balchandra Jharki Oli, Ramesh Jharki Oli, in Uttam Patil, in Nippani, Pradeep Kumar Malage, his son, Pradeep Kumar Malage, Rayabaga, they will all jump to JDS. They will call Nagesh Mandalkar. BJP will be defeated. We have 11, right? In 11, Gokak, Arbavi, Kagwada, Athani, Nippani, in the other side, Rayabaga, in the other side, BJP will be defeated in 6-7 places. In the end, when they enter, it will be a loss to Congress. 11 will be minus 6. 5 BJP will be there. Congress will be defeated. 11 will be there. They will win Balchandra in JDS. They will win Ramesh. They will win Srimanth Patil. What will happen to Mahesh Kumar Tally? One ticket of Athani will destroy the future of BJP. If Mahesh Kumar Tally is given, BJP will be saved. If Lakshman Sawati is given, BJP will be washed out in the morning. Gokak will not come in the deposit. Sir, I am not standing on Ramesh Jharkhand. I am standing on Lakshman Sawati's party flag. I am an MLC. I will go and ask the villagers. We have discussed this last time. We have made a video on Athani. We have discussed this in the press meet. What will you do if Lakshman Sawati is given a ticket? You can watch it on Karnataka TV. You can watch it on Karnataka TV. We have discussed this. What do you think? I am afraid that people will think that I am a fool. I am afraid that people will think that I am a fool. In the March survey of Karnataka TV, in Belgavi district, in the 11th district, BJP, in the 7th district, Congress, we have written the progress. The trend will change. We will work on it."

 Welcome back. Now Karnataka Congress Chief DK Shivkumar has dropped a bombshell in his interview with Mirror Now. Now Mr. Shivkumar says the BJP pressurised him to quit Congress. He claims he was offered the position of Deputy Chief Minister if he switched loyalties and joined the BJP. Now DKS made this stunning revelation while speaking exclusively to my colleague Shreya. Listen in. You've spoken about pressure on you from the BJP. Was there pressure on you to quit the Congress and join the BJP at any point of time, sir? Aye, oh my God, there is a big story behind it, I think. You have to ask some of the BJP friends. I don't want to tell. I don't want to be. I don't want to be active. They wanted me to leave this Congress party. A lot of things are there. But I stand by loyalty to the Congress party and the leadership. I'm a congressman. I'll die as a congressman. So you're telling me there was pressure on you. Quit the Congress and join the BJP, sir? Yes, of course. Of course. Of course. And when was this pressure, sir? I don't want to disclose the names, the confidential name, who all I spoke. I don't want to disclose. Lot for lot, three, four years, it was. It is running like anything. And everyone in the state knows about it. Can I ask you then, you know, what you make of the BJP's move? Including, I'm telling, including an officer who is at the rank of the DG, I'm telling you. I know what they pressurized me, how they pressurized me. I just gave an interview in some TV. I picked a jail, then having a deputy CM post that was on record. So you were offered the deputy CM's post? Yes. In turn for dumping the Congress party and joining the BJP? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Dr. Sameer Kagarkar, Karnataka BJP spokesperson, joins me on the broadcast over the phone lines for a reaction on this. Dr. Kagarkar, good evening. Thank you for speaking to us on Mrina. All right, we have you live. Thank you very much for joining us. Your first reaction with DK Shivkumar's statement? I seriously pity Mr. DK Shivkumar. He's been forced to make these kinds of outrageous statements. It's simply a matter of an internal popularity contest. He's trying to contest with Sidharam Iyer, who is much more popular, much more considered capable for a CM's post. If you look at DK Shivkumar's statement, it's in a way trying to make a claim to the CM's post by saying that I gave up a deputy CM's position. This is as ridiculous and outrageous as it can get. There's a saying in Sanskrit that says, ""Ena keena prakaareena prasiddha purushobhava"". You know, you bray like a donkey, you shout like a madman, do whatever you want to, but become popular. This is as outrageous as that. I mean, if he has a problem with Sidharam Iyer, let him sort it out on a popularity basis internally. He need not have to make this. Just to put the matter very clear, BJP has enough and more internal, capable, committed candidates who can be deputy CMs. We don't need an import from the Bihar jail for sure. So just to summarize it, it's an absolute outrageous statement by DK Shivkumar. All right, Dr. Kalkar, we leave it to that. Thank you very much for joining us on the broadcast and giving us your reaction on the same. But for the moment, we leave it to that and shift our focus to other news that we're tracking this evening."

 Ramanavami is a violent incident in West Bengal. Two ghosts in the middle of the road, a death-threatening incident in Komodallur. We are ashamed to say Rahul. This is an insult to those who have taken Modi's surname. This is Sushil Kumar Modi against the leader. And the entry is Corona. Yesterday afternoon, one day, 3,016 cases of Corona were reported. In the last 6 months, more cases have been reported. Before the election, the state has issued a case. One day, 215 cases of Corona were reported. In the entire state of Bengaluru, 75 cases were reported. Mask is worn in the body due to Corona. Those who have symptoms of Corona should wear a mask. Health information that there is no need to be scared. Mahiti"

 India Today's Nabila has just had this exclusive first conversation with the Congress State President of Karnataka, D.K. Shivakumar. Take a look at this exclusive. What did the dates do for the Congress party? Are you in a huddle now to roll out the second list of candidates? I'm very happy. The election commission has said that one day it is good for the Congress party. And a lot of demands were there. They were just trying to loot every day. Misuse of government machinery. The earlier the better. Short term for the election preparation. We agree with it. But we have an objection on this 80 years of voting which has been announced. But they will try to misuse the official machinery. We are going to file our objection on that 80 years of age. Because almost 7-8000 voters... - Nearly 12 lakhs. 12 lakh voters, they want to misuse them using the official machinery. But don't you think it's convenient for them if it... No, no. It may be convenient. But at the same time they have the government in their hand. It is a caretaker government. They will try to misuse but we will be very cautious on this point. Sir, here the election commission has spoken about money bags and warned people flexing with money. There was a video that has come out of yours throwing some cash at people. Bombay has accused that this is Congress's nature. Bombay, I don't know, he has to churn about 8 crores of money seized in his own MLA. That he has to answer. He has not answered. Prime Minister has not answered. He has to answer on 40% commission. He has to answer on PSA scam in which he was the Home Minister. He is the father of corruption in Karnataka. And he and his government. Because why they changed the Chief Minister and one minister has to resign on a bed, one has to resign on corruption. So what more do you need? You don't need any other replies to it. It is the Lokayakta has given a reply. He was asking for us. What is the witness and Lokayakta has given a witness to him. Sir, you know, as much as we see that the Congress is now trying hard to make it to the finish point with a win this time, there is also a lot of talk about who is going to be the CM face. Is DK Shiv Kumar going to be the CM in Karnataka if Congress wins? Let's not discuss on the CM. May 10th is a day for a change. May 10th is a day to root out corruption. May 10th is a day for the good governance of Karnataka. For a better Bangalore, for a global Karnataka. And it will be for a change. I think the double engine has failed. And a new engine for a prosperous and a progressive Karnataka will come on May 10th. And I wish that the people of Karnataka will use the new engine. Alright, we heard you. But is Congress reverse engineering? Are you trying to forge BJP Netas? Bombay says that you are making calls. No, BJP leaders are on the way. A lot of people, they wanted to leave the BJP. They know that the engine has failed and they are coming. But see, four years, Mr. Puttanna, he is a graduate teacher, he resigned. Mr. Baburao Chinchissori, he is a sitting M.Sc. Like that, sitting legislators who are there, who had that term, have resigned. They feel that they did not get their voice, they did not get their choice, they feel that it is the most corrupt government, they can't face the people of Karnataka with this type of administration. So they all are on the way to join the Congress party. Disqualified Rahul Gandhi is going to come to Kolar for a yatra. Is that going to help? He is being disqualified by the BJP leader. He is not being disqualified by the people of Karnataka, the people of this country. People love him. He has joined the people of this country on Bharat Jodo. That is a big strength. So he is coming here on 5th April. Satya Meva Jayate rally is going to start. That will be the beginning of the end of Karnataka"

He does like that But if you want to give it as a minister You have to give it as a minister Where is the position of the wise guru? In the 4th house The position of the married chief is low And where he should not talk to anyone He talks to them and makes them to separate Where he should not sit, he sits The person's attitude will be different Here, look In which Saturn In Sidramayya's horoscope He is giving more positive signs Saturn is here, it is in the 10th house It is in the 9th house But here, why is it negative? The wise guru is in a bad state Saturn is in the 10th house And in a bad state, there is another planet The married chief has a bad vision What does this show? He does not sit near the 10th house He does not sit near the 10th house If you keep the person who does not sit in front You will not be able to sit In this time, the married chief is in a bad state In the horoscope of the wise guru He is in a bad state He cannot do anything What is the problem here? For the person who is in a position of authority The married chief is the deciding factor For any person Even in a family The husband The married chief is a very important job Here, the married chief is in a bad state The married chief has a disorder Because, he is a beginner And he is a very playful person He thinks that he can do everything He thinks that he can do everything He thinks that he can do everything This is the quality of the married chief This is the quality of the married chief That is why the married chief is called very impatient They are dependable The married chief and the married chief are definitely dependable If we compare them with other 12 signs They are very dependable The married chief and the married chief But the planet that gives the nutrition is the Kuja This Kuja is the fourth The fourth is the food The water to drink, the mother to raise The happiness to sleep The yoga of relaxation From which ever place the person finds happiness That is the fourth place In that fourth place the married chief is bad So, he is stuck there If a person from any of these places has to find a big place In that place itself there is no fault The yoga of experiencing the high places is not there I have made it clear then and I am telling it today Pranav Sharmaji Definitely, because He has come to know about the yoga from the Shani and Guru in the 10th house Now it is the Shani Dasa The 10th house The marriage chief is in the 10th house How will be his state in that yoga He will not listen to anyone He will not listen to anyone He will not listen to anyone He will not listen to anyone He will not listen to anyone He will not listen to anyone So, even in the elections how the elections should be conducted there is a method he has to accept that possibility Since the Guru is also there in that, one method as he said what he does what he does if he is called bad he has to go back That is the yoga Shukra is in the Vedas The Shukra in the Vedas in his Bhukti time definitely, Shani Shukra Shani Shukra is a very good method in the Dasa Bhukti Shukra Dasa Shani Bhukti or in Shani Dasa Shukra Bhukti the person can go to a very good position But for his Jatka in Shukra Bhukti, it is a possibility that it will be good that is, getting a good position getting a good position getting some benefit is definitely not seen in Shani Dasa Shukra Bhukti Also, since the Guru is not there the possibilities are less 40 people are watching Kundali D.K. Shivakumar has less chances of becoming CM has less chances of becoming CM Sidhramaiah has the same chances both the guests said both said no What is Kumar Swamy's Jatka saying?

 and the head of the MLA party, Mr. Siddharamaiah, Mr. B. K. Hariprasad, the MLA party head, the MLA party MPs, all our leaders, Mr. Satish Jharkhawli, Mr. Salim, all our leaders, all our AC Secretaries, all the Chief Ministers, we have all come to you in large numbers to give you a million salutations. This is a historic event. We have started this Prajadoni program from this land. Mahatma Gandhiji wanted to drive out the British from this land. This blessed land was owned by the Congress from 1924. We wanted to drive out the BJP corrupt government from this blessed land. We have all made a pledge and started from here. Today, the MLA's and Rahul Gandhi's, wherever Mahatma Gandhiji has placed the Congress as the leader, from the same place, after the end of the Bharat Jodha, they have made a pledge to give a non-independent Karnataka state to the Karnataka state and to give a state free of corruption. They have come here today to make all their intentions come true. I am very happy. We cannot deny that this is a historic event. I have a belief, the Congress has a belief, that the Congress is the power of this country. The Congress history is the history of this country. This belief that we all have about the youth, women, farmers, workers, is a great belief. It is our duty to protect all these people by keeping this belief. In this water, we have come to a great historic gathering. We have come from the airport. There are about 4-5 people standing on the road. I have come to offer a million salutations to them. Friends, Rajiv Gandhi has an unwavering belief in the youth. He wants to give the right to vote again from 21 to 18. He said this in the Parliament. We have been believing in the youth of our country for 16 years. We have been sending them to the borders to protect this nation. Today, when MPs and MLAs are being appointed to the Prime Minister's post, when the Panchayat is appointed to the Parliament, we have been giving our belief in the youth, we have been sending them to the borders. Today, we have come to the Congress to give them the right to vote. They said that India is an old country but a young nation. So, the youth have come to the Congress to give strength to the youth. We have come to the Congress to give them the strength to create jobs and to do their job well. So, the Congress has decided to give them a unique opportunity. In Karnataka, in Kaski, we are creating jobs for Karnataka people. We are creating a law that gives jobs to the youth of Karnataka. In Kaski, today, thousands of people are working without jobs. Today, we have established the Kaski Employment Exchange. Everyone should get employment in Kaski. Everyone should get employment in Kaski through the government's employment exchange. We have also created a program to get all the unemployed people out of the government. We have also created a program to get all the unemployed people out of the government. We have also created a program to get all the unemployed people out of the government. The Congress has done a great job. We have created a program to get the unemployed people out of the government.

 And on a day when we kick off our big daily Karnataka election coverage The showdown over the Karnataka government scrapping the 4% reservation for the Muslim community has escalated into a huge statewide issue Protests have broken out from Shivamogga to Koppal to other parts of the state as angry locals have hit the street against Chief Minister Bombay's move In Yedirappa's hometown of Shikaripura in Shivamogga members of the scheduled caste Banjara community also protested against the scrapping of the reservation pelting stones even at Yedirappa's home and office in that town Well a day after Home Minister Amit Shah hailed the move Congress has mounted a fresh attack on the BJP Former Karnataka Chief Minister Siddharamaiah has questioned why the BJP never removed this 4% Muslim quota for over 25 years and suddenly decided to take the step now Well this comes after Congress State President D.K. Shivakumar vowed that the Congress would bring back the Muslim quota immediately if they come back to power reiterating confidence that they will win the upcoming election Meanwhile the BJP's C.T. Ravi has questioned if such a religious quota was there anywhere else in the country and thereby justified the Bombay government's move Congress leaders have questioned the BJP's move. They have questioned the BJP's move. After the BJP has given the Muslim quota to the people, they have been giving such a torture to the people. The Banjara community should not be involved in this torture. The BJP has been protecting the Banjara community from the beginning. We will continue to protect the community. We should not allow such attempts to lead to wrong path. I am sorry for the mistake that the Congress has made. On behalf of Congress party, I would like to condemn the decision of this government. Politically they are trying to do it. It did not serve the purpose. It did not, we did not, the Lingayats or Vakaligas are not beggars. So they are trying to divide among ourselves. We are not interested with that 4% or 2% whatever they are given. Congress party, as soon as we form the government in May, we are going to scrap this. Muslims were given 4% reservation, not on the basis of the religion. Constitution does not say the reservation should be on religion. Otherwise they should have challenged the reservation in court of law. Since 29 years it is there. Anybody has challenged it? In other states, is there a separate reservation for Muslims? In which state is it? The constitution does not give such a Muslim reservation. It does not give religious reservation. Some people think against the constitution, they talk about Muslim reservation. And starting 6.30pm this evening, all weekdays will be our new special focus on the upcoming Karnataka election. Fronted by India Today's Nabila on the ground in Bengaluru and other parts of the state. State Karnataka today. And Nabila is live with me from the beautiful city of Bengaluru. Nabila all set, 6.30pm is your first show today. We are going to be expanding our coverage in a very big way. What's the big story today at 6.30? Shiv, super excited to be back home. My home state Karnataka. There is a lot of action happening as of now. I am right in front of the BJP office here. We had a big press conference from Union Minister Narayan Swamy on the reservation. In fact, a big bold move made by the Bombay government right in time of election. They have scrapped 4% quota, reservation quota that was given to Muslims in Karnataka. And that's now resulted in huge uproar. We saw Muslims across the state protesting. The other Banjara community and other community that were given reservation earlier. Their quota has been rephrased and reframed. So it appears that reservation politics has dominated this election season this time around. One month ahead of elections, will the BJP with its moves really manage to galvanize the support here in the state? Will they be able to actually turn these decisions into electoral games is something that we need to see. But every little angle that Karnataka elections right now is facing will be presented to our viewers at 6.30pm today. Super excited, Shiv. And Nabila will also be reporting on the dates being announced. It's going to happen any day now. We're expecting it to happen sometime this week. Nabila and her team in Bengaluru will get us the very latest. Remember, 6.30pm we'll all be looking out for that. Thanks very much, Nabila, for joining me on the show."

 want to bring in Mr. Yadav the Congress spokesperson back into this conversation Mr. Yadav you know okay you want to stick on being you know you want to continue to call him Nalayak which you say is useless but it is bizarre it is bizarre sir that any politician of the day disregard of their political party can turn around and call the person who's heading the police enforcement in a state Nalayak publicly sir it just shows belligerence it just shows political entitlement I want to ask you the second part of the statement what did he mean when he said when we come to power is that a threat one let me let me let me be very very clear to you there is no threat to a DGP we have due respect for DGP we respect the constitutional post will respect the constitutionally based institutions no doubt about it now I am asking you as a DGP rights in Shivamakalai a Hindu Muslim clash was there 144 cabinet minister Eswarappa took a huge position how did the DGP allow this to happen in Karnataka state this is what I'm trying to question it you have a law for BJP one different law for Congress different law for JDS different law so you are allowed to call so I think you know what is getting lost in translation Mr. Yadav is you are allowed to highlight the inefficient police system in Karnataka you are allowed to complain hear me out sir you are allowed to complain about it because you feel it's partisan it's your right to do so as an opposition you must do so if you feel so but to call somebody Nalayak and to give them a threat and when we come to power we will fix you this is political entitlement sir no hundred percent DK Shukumar sir being a very responsible person being the PCC president he didn't mean that he was trying to say that when we come to power we'll put law and order in its place we cannot allow these things to go upon like that anybody who's taken a law in the BJP's hand when BJP's regime if any officer has taken the law into their hand and they're not behave properly and constitutionally they will be punished because they are supposed to do their duties on time that is what the Congress may mean to that it is not that vindictive or not that it's going to take a political action against the DGP DGP is a very right person we have due respect for him now the BJP is not allowing independently the DGP to function that is the whole issue behind all this thing when you would have been DGP being the highest position in Karnataka State Police Department and the Home Minister is the Home Minister the Chief Minister is not allowing to run the show as per the Constitution of India they are done they want the DGP to act as a BJP worker and 25 cases of filed against my leaders including CLP leader and the KPCC president for no reason at the same point of time 141st section is broken by the BJP leaders no cases are taken against them they violated so many number of times the law and order of Karnataka State so many communal cases only because of BJP workers why are you not taking the action against them? why this much salad in Karnataka State? Captain Karnik once again which I'll repeat this question your party your government is accused of using the enforcement law and order the police in Karnataka to serve your political means but that aside the Congress has written to the EC and what's wrong in that there's nothing wrong they feel that this dispensation in terms of the DSP needs to change because they feel it's partisan there's an election coming and there's a lot at stake correct Preeti this political battle is fine Mr. D K Shukumar complains about BJP misusing let him complain no issues he specifically refers to 26 cases on Congress karakartas and it is intentional and that is why he calls him nalai he also threatens by saying that we will come back to power after this election we will teach you a lesson now this is condemnable see politically when I'm in power if I use you know others may feel that I'm using the police force when they are in power I feel that they're using force I will complain about DK you know DK Ganapati's suicide Sir let him finish I'll come to you I will blame the political I don't blame the police I'm not saying that you know DK Shukumar as party president should not complain about party let him politically he is well within his rights to complain about BJP a 30 year plus service senior police officer who has the police force in Karnataka in public you call him nalai and then say we may come back to power we'll see you this is absolutely ridiculous he cannot do it he's a responsible person heading a political party in the state he was a former minister"

 The JDS leaders are now trying to give us the Rajanamayee. Can you tell us about this? What is the reason behind giving the Rajanamayee to the JDS? The reason for giving the Rajanamayee is that the party has been disillusioned. We have been disillusioned and so we have given it. You have been a leader who has been very popular among the JDS. You have also been a threat to RCK. Do you have any faith in winning over the JDS? Winning or losing is not important to me. When I was disillusioned, I decided to take the Rajakaran in India. Why should I give a speciality to this? There is no speciality. We have seen thousands of incidents where everyone has taken the Rajakaran. Some have left the party, some have come to the elections. We have given it because we were disillusioned. For the past two years, you have not done any work in the party. You have been saying that you are going to win over the JDS. I have not won over anyone. Nothing has happened. I have not done anything. I am here. I have said that I will listen to the people. I have agreed to what they have said.

 I would like to tell the Chief Ministers that you have violated the self-respect of our state. You have left the right to come and rule over this state for your own rights. We are not ready to accept anyone from any state of Karnataka. The President of India, the Governor and the Central Government has called for you to be removed from office. Your government should be removed from office. You should be allowed to rule over this state. The Government has called for this. The Maharashtra Government has been given a notice. Article 356 has been given. No Sir? Yes, Article 356. According to Article 356, the Maharashtra Government has been called to be removed from office. All the leaders of the Congress have been called to be removed from office. This is a matter of the Constitution. In the civil society, no one has the right to say that we went to Punjab, we went to Tamil Nadu, we went to Kerala. We are not ready to do our duty there. The problems we have faced are the water and electricity problems. The roads have been blocked. All these have been solved through the government. We have given water and electricity to the people who have no water. We have given water to the people who have no electricity. All these have been solved through the government. In our state, the foreign states have come and made a mistake. They have given us money and have made us work on our own. They have made us work on their health and their own. This is a matter of the Constitution. Which government should interfere in this? Both these governments should be removed. One is here, they have not even noticed anything. The Chief Minister has given a statement in this Karnataka state. The neighboring states are trying to interfere in our area. I am doing a report on this matter. 26 people are present in the Parliament. 5-6 people are ministers. All of them are self-respecting. They have not tried to save the state of Karnataka. They are trying to give up their state. I am doing a report on this matter. This is a criminal act of a BJP government in a adjacent state. We are also present in this matter. We are the people. We have to give an answer. We have to save this state. I am here to give you a statement. I will give you a statement in the opposition leader's statement. We do, we do."

 in and this bulletin this coming in from Karnataka as the battle for Karnataka is intensifying viewers the Natka Congress meeting is all set to begin shortly at a ICC office and not Congress leader Siddharth Maya DK Shiva Kumar DK Suresh along with others to be present in the meeting and meeting is to be headed by Malika to NKaragai beating for a final round of ticket for Karnataka assembly elections so we're seeing that how Congress in is in full election mode now and in the run-up to the Karnataka polls the Congress is now of course getting together it's a key meet that is slated for today this is regarding the second candidate list Congress is in action mode and my colleague is Harsha is joining us on the broadcast for more on this Harsha it's a very important meeting that is coming in a second candidate list as far as Karnataka polls is concerned and the Congress Party remember we've seen a lot of we've seen a lot of fissures in the Congress Party as far as the candidate list was concerned there was a lot of tensions within the party as far as the candidate list were concerned there were many protests also we see a few days ago on that and how do we see it now panning out for the Congress Party exactly as you rightly stated few days before also we saw protests happening in Karnataka where the local local local leaders and local party karakatas were protesting and it happened because there were several BJP leaders and the JDS leaders as well who joined the Congress Party directly and there was a agitation amongst the supporters that the ticket should not be given to the leaders who have come from the different party and now we are showing you the visuals as the meeting for the Central Election Committee has already begun Siddhir Amaya, DK Shiv Kumar, DK Suresh and Balikarjun Khadge, MB Patil, BK Hari Prasad and Randeep Singh Surjevala are going to participate in this meeting of Central Election Committee where the second list for the candidates will be announced and it will be finalized because till now what we are learning is that 124 candidate have already been announced on on March of 25th and now the names for the second list has to be finalized for the hundred seats and it becomes very important because Siddhir Amaya and DK Shiv Kumar's name was in the first list. Siddhir Amaya was supposed to contest from the Varuna Assembly constituency while DK Shiv Kumar from the Kanakpura Assembly constituency but what we are learning is that Siddhir Amaya already expressed that he wants to also fight from Kolar Assembly constituency but there were several disagreements from the local party leaders from that particular constituency because of which till now the Kolar Assembly constituency have not been given to Siddhir Amaya and today a very important list will be finalized of the hundred candidates which has to be revealed after this meeting of the Central Election Committee commences at the AICC head office because the leaders have already come and now we are also seeing the local leaders and karikatas from the Karnataka who are here outside AICC office were expecting their name to be in the second list of Karnataka Assembly constituency because elections are on May 10th and the results will be declared on 13th of May and till now we have been seeing that what is the model which Congress leaders have been projecting on ground is that corrupt free Karnataka because they have been stating that BJP have been compromising with the corruption activities over there in Karnataka and that's what they are completely hitting again and again on the Basavaraj Bomay government completely stating that they are involved in the corruption activities and that is what we have to eradicate from the Karnataka. So this is a very important meeting as we show you several Karnataka leaders, karikatas and supporters have already gathered out outside the AICC office and all eyes on the Kolar constituency because Siddhir Amaya also wants the Kolar Assembly constituency that he should be fielded from this constituency as well but till now there were disagreements amongst the local party leaders because of which Congress is not much in favor of the idea of Siddhir Amaya to be fielded from that very Kolar constituency as well. Back to you. Right Harsha and as we were talking about the infighting and the protests within the Congress party before the list came out this of course is the second list that is scheduled to be released soon. We're talking about two important figures here as far as Congress is concerned in Karnataka. Harsha we have a DK Shiv Kumar and we have a Siddhir Amaya. Are we also expecting that there will be some talks and are you picking up anything on who will be the CM face for a Congress party as far as this battleground Karnataka is concerned? Till now the party has not opened its cards who is going to be the CM candidate because a lot of tussle on ground is already being seen between the two very important leaders Siddhir Amaya and DK Shiv Kumar and all eyes are on that only that who will be the CM candidate Congress is going to project whom because DK Shiv Kumar since from the very first day of campaigning has been stating that right now I am the Karnataka Congress president but he has a high scope for becoming the CM candidate as well but Siddhir Amaya being the former CM his hopes are also high that this time also the Congress is going to project him as the CM candidate but what exactly the Karnataka leaders are thinking let me straight go to them. Sir what all you are thinking about the CM candidate because you all are here outside AICC who should be the CM candidate because right now there's a lot of tussle between Siddhir Amaya and DK Shiv Kumar both the big leaders of Karnataka. I think the party should give both the people the opportunity madam two and a half years for them two and a half years for them. So these are the thoughts of the leaders and local karikatas who are present outside AICC so we need to wait and watch exactly what will come outside from the central election meeting of Congress back to you. Right of course alright thank you so much Harsha for getting us all those inputs on that story we'll keep coming back to you for more on that story in the run-up to the battleground cricket match."

 Namaskara, I am Sharmita Shetty. In the state politics, the opposition party Meesalathi A2 and Yeduretu are fighting fiercely. Congress has expressed its opposition to the government's Meesalathi decision. If the BJP government changes the decisions taken by Meesalathi, the BJP leaders will be in a dilemma. If the BJP leaders are in a dilemma, they will have to change the government's decision. You are sitting here and reading the news. Why are you not giving a little bit of your vote? Why do you need to do this? You are beggars. You should have gone to Lingayat. You called Swamigal and told him that you will go and do good work. We are not beggars. All this is a contest. After 40 days, Congress will come to power. What you have done, you have done it. Congress has come to power to give justice to the society. I would like to say this. If you say that you have done it for Swamigal, it is an insult. We have given this Meesalathi to the Meesalathi of Lingayat and Vallameesalathi. They are all in the state of calm. Only Congress is shivering. We have kept them in a cage for 80 people. Congress and JDS are shivering for 80 people. If they had the power and the courage, they would have seen Meesalathi on the stage. Congress has no choice. If you want to take any backwoods class decision or if you want shares, there should be a recommendation from the Permanent Backwoods Class Commission. There is the Permanent Backwoods Class Commission report. There is a report that says to take a small number. We call this a political gimmick. We don't want to give justice to anyone. When you look at the history of BJP Meesalathi, he has never been a social leader. He has made a proposal to the workers' society to give 4% to 6% and to Vallameer Salathi. He has taken a decision that no one can oppose. I feel that this decision is a good sign. Swamiji and all the social leaders have expressed their happiness. ...and it will be good for their future."

 Siddaraman said that D.K.Shi has no place in Congress as Chief Minister. Siddaraman, who never said that, is now questioning. Siddaraman gave the opportunity to the English vehicle, but he is questioning it now. I and CM are both candidates for Chief Minister. I and D.K.Shi Kumar are both candidates for Chief Minister. In the people's government, all these are common. There is nothing wrong in it. Whether it is D.K.Shi or me, it is not wrong to be the CM. It is my last election, last electoral fight. I am not going out of the active politics. I will be in active politics. I will continue in active politics. But as far as the electoral politics is concerned, this will be my last election. I am also an aspirant for the CM post. D.K.Shi Kumar is also an aspirant for the CM post. In democracy, these things are happening, do happening. Nothing wrong in that. D.K.Shi Kumar wants to become the CM, nothing wrong. If I want to become the CM, some ex-mic wants to become the CM, nothing wrong. Ultimately, the newly elected MLAs, they have to elect the leader of the Legislature Party. Ultimately, the High Command has to take a decision. That is democracy. He has written down his statement. I will say that he is an aspirant for the Democratic Party. I am also an aspirant for it. That's all he has said. But I have not said anything else. Now, our representative Raghav Sharma will give us more details. In the Raghav Sharma Congress, Siddaramaya, D.K.Shi Kumar, CM Ghadiya, the aspirants have come to present their statements in every media outlet. Did they present their statements in the election? Or did they change their statement? Siddaramaya and the National Development Minister met in the election. I am also an aspirant for the CM. D.K.Shi Kumar, who is the KPCC Chief Minister, is also an aspirant. The CM is not wrong to be an aspirant. He has also given us details on how the process of electing the CM will be carried out. On one hand, it is a democratic process. That is, the CLP, all the government officials are elected first. The person they elect is the CM. He has clearly stated that. So, it is not wrong to be an aspirant. There is a democratic system in the party. Anyone can be elected as a CM. Not just me, but other people can also be the CM. In 2013, when I was in Congress, T.B. Jayachandra also came to Delhi and said that he will be the CM. He tried to make me an aspirant. So, this is a democratic system in the party. So, in the same way, the ICA Actor has made a statement. But in the National Development Minister's statement, it misinterpreted it. It said that D.K. Shivakumar does not need a CM. So, some of the Karnataka media also misinterpreted it. So, there was a lot of disagreement between Sidramaiah and the ICA. Today, Sidramaiah has spoken to a journalist at the Maurya Sheraton Hotel. He has presented the misinterpretation of the National Development Minister's statement. So, Sidramaiah has spoken about it. This is a false statement. I have never made such a statement. I said that there is a democratic process in the party. Through that, the ICA process will be conducted to select the CM. So, if D.K. Shivakumar also joins the party, I will also join. So, ultimately, the high command and the party leaders will decide. This is what they clearly said. So, in this way, in the context of clarifying the statement, there was a lot of disagreement and disagreement between Sidramaiah and the ICA. Raghav Sharma, I think the clarification was very important. Because, in the election campaign, there was a lot of disagreement between the two leaders regarding this. Mostly, this statement continued. So, I think Sidramaiah has made a lot of efforts to clarify it. Srishti, if Sidramaiah had made a statement in the same way, it would have been a condemnation statement in the party. Because, in the context of the election, the ticket list is being prepared. So, in this context, if Sidramaiah had given a statement that D.K. Shivakumar is not the CM, it would have been a great struggle for the party. But, Sidramaiah, you too might have seen in the campaign, Sidramaiah did not make such a statement. At one time, the party high command and the party leaders decided who should be the CM. They clearly made a statement that would make sense. So, in this context, Sidramaiah's clarification was very important. If Sidramaiah has given a false statement, it would be a chance to harm the party. The opposition parties would take advantage of this and create a political narrative that everything is not right in Congress. So, any question can be raised. The truth should be clarified. The media should also be able to propagate the statements with an answer. So, Sidramaiah has given a statement that will be clarified. He was on the Congress side. So, he has clarified the statement. Okay, Raghav Sharma. Thank you for the information."

 CEC meeting is tomorrow, we are going there. Meeting is on 4th. It will be finalized in 7 days. When is the meeting? I am not the one who is going to attend the meeting. Mallikarajan Kergevar should sign it. After he signs it, it will be done. Sir, all the people who have come, have they said anything? They have come, but they are more eager. Sir, in some places, they have said that they will give Samuditarajan. See, blackmail and all that, it has not happened in Congress party. It has happened in all the parties. In all the parties, BJP has said that it will not happen. Why are they pending the list without announcing it? Why are they delaying it till 7th? Why are they delaying it till 5th? They too have internal problems as much as they want. Internal problems are increasing in the public. Now, from KR Petta, last time Abirathyagi's father, he gave Rajinam to his party. Madhu Bangara's father joined. All those who stood in the Liberation movement joined. All those who were in JDS joined. MLAs. Yesterday, BJP went to the Dardai and joined. They asked our party, ""We have become anti-incumbent because of you."" We told them. Then, they joined us. We have nothing against them. So, it is in all the parties. But, only BJP's opponents are being criticized. News first, Shannon."

 If elections come, it's enough. The politicians will run temple runs. No politician will run for this. Similarly, the KPCC leader DK Shiv Kumar, who is sitting on the CM's chair, has also gone to Devaramore. In his horoscope, he is facing a tough time. He is facing a tough time. What is tough? What is DK Shiv Kumar showing? They are saying that Rahu-Ketu is a sin. What is Rahu-Ketu's sin? If it is so, what will happen? If Rahu-Ketu is a sin, he will be in a lot of trouble in life. He already has a lot of work pressure, party pressure. DK Shiv Kumar is under all the pressure to take the party forward. How can he get some mental peace from this? So, that is why Rahu-Ketu is doing Homo. Some mothers have the possibility of getting rid of their unhappiness, unwellness, and even their loved ones. They might get sick, their loved ones might get far away. Are you making paper plates by learning Freedom App? If so, then give your paper plates to the Freedom App users who have more than 1 crore. Do it at any cost. There might be some misunderstandings. DK Shiv Kumar is facing all these. So, he needs to get rid of all these problems. Next, if we see, if a person has a mental problem, if Rahu-Ketu sin starts, from the perspective of Rahu, the person might get into mental trouble. DK Shiv Kumar is also experiencing the same problem. Financial loss, bad memories, loss of things, the possibility of anger, if Rahu-Ketu sin happens, if something bad happens to him in his life, the possibility of that incident happening again and again, Rahu-Ketu sin happens. So, fear and enemies are increasing. DK Shiv Kumar has one or two enemies. How many enemies are there? They might be political enemies, or personal enemies. He is facing all of them. So, he needs to be more powerful. To get rid of these enemies, to get rid of Rahu-Ketu sin, he went to Home. Next, let us see, a wrong imagination. There are a lot of misunderstandings. Court cases. You all must have noticed how many times DK Shiv Kumar has gone to court. ED, IT, CBI, one or two. DK Shiv Kumar goes to court 2-3 times a month to come to court. He has to come to clarification court. DK Shiv Kumar is facing that problem. This is a lot of pressure. DK Shiv Kumar has done that. What happened next? Let us see. There are chances of health problems. If Ketu is at fault, there will be a problem in his health. So, DK Shiv Kumar has decided that there should not be any health problem. Now, Rahu-Ketu sin has happened. DK Shiv Kumar has offered pooja to Kaala Bhairava. Kaala Bhairava is a very powerful God. DK Shiv Kumar has remembered him. Now, DK Shiv Kumar has gone to Yagav. He has done special Yagav. He has said, ""God, please give me salvation from all problems and troubles. I have decided to become CM."" DK Shiv Kumar has started the temple run. (Temple run) The heat of the Akhada is increasing day by day. The political issues are getting heated. In this battlefield, the women are ready to fight against the enemies. They are doing their best to win. No political leaders have fallen behind. Meanwhile, many KPCC charioteers, DK Shiv Kumar has also gone to Yagav to win. Let's see, why did the KPCC charioteer go to Yagav? In the election, Rahu-Ketu went to DK. In the election, KPCC chairman, DK Shiv Kumar has gone to Rahu-Ketu. Since then, from Bangalore to Tirupati, DK has been running. From Tirupati to Kaala Bhairava, Rahu-Ketu has done Shanti Homa. In the election, DK Shiv Kumar, who has gone to Yagav, has done Amavasya pooja to Kaala Bhairava. Now, Rahu-Ketu has done Shanti Homa. This country has planned to escape from the danger. A few days back, in the news first, Simhasana Bhavishya, it was said about the crime of DK. Now, DK who has gone to that area, Rahu-Ketu has done Shanti Homa. Since DK is a Mesha Lagna, in this April, Guru Meena Rashi is coming for Mesha Lagna. Now, because of Guru Chandala Yoga, it is not a good yoga. So, to escape from the fault of Guru Chandala Yoga, DK has done Rahu Shanti Homa. Now, the Kaala Hasti who is going to DK, has his own ideal power. From the Sangkishta of Rahu Desi, many celebrities and politicians are going to meet Kaala Hasti. In the horoscope of DK, Rahu Pratyantara, after the election, till June, till 16th June, Shani Dasha Shukra Bhukti Rahu Pratyantara. Since Gochar Rahu is in Lagna, Guru Rahu Sairi, since Rahu Pratyantara is there, he is in a good mood. So, he is going to Kaala Hasti for Puja. So, from the 12th Mani Jintha, the Guru who is coming for Lagna is very good. If we leave aside the fact that Rahu is there, it is not a matter of getting into a state of fear. If you come to Namavamsa, you can see that Rahu is in a good mood. His children are fine, so there is no need to get into a state of fear. If you do Puja, you will not face any problem. Many people are dreaming of winning the next war and sitting in the throne of power. On this, DK Shivakumar has also cast his eye on CM Gandhi and has made Rahu, Ketu and Shanti a joke.

 Instead of Rajiv Gandhi's name, you have changed it to Ganga's Hanumanthai's name. Why is the C.M. voting against this? Ram Nagarajan. When the time comes to do that, we will talk about it. Do you understand? Rajiv Gandhi's name should be changed. His name should be put. By May 18th, the Congress government will be in this state. We know what kind of politics we should do then. We will do politics. We will take away their rights. They don't know what they are talking about. They don't know. The Congress party is doing the work of correcting the mistakes of the reservation.

 D.K.C has been a bad influence to BJP's internal miscellaneous activities. They are fooling everyone in Bombay. The communities that gave support to BJP are committing robberies. The Koli community has been unfair to the state government. Koli community gave miscellaneous food. They increased the miscellaneous food intake by 7%. D.K.C has been a bad influence to BJP's internal miscellaneous activities. The CMs are always fooling people. They gave bus pass to PM. They gave speeches in the manifesto. Their budget is over. They announced the ST category to Koli community. So, we have not got any ST category. That is why D.K.C has been a bad influence to Koli community. We have asked for 10-15% of the house rent. Panchamshala has also asked for it. We have asked them to give 2-2% of the house rent. We have asked them to give the amount of the population. They have not done it according to the law. All the CMs have been fooling people. They have been a bad influence to the state government. That is why, every decision taken in this month, the CMs are fooling people. This is the result of the election."

 we have been giving the king's name since last 5 days, we should not be giving it now, we have given it till the congress comes. Now, you are deciding that there is no future in JDS and giving the king's name. The question of whether there is a future in JDS or not, the leaders who have voted for us have got a slight disagreement. There is no discussion of disagreement here. When there is a discussion of disagreement, in politics, it can be left aside. This is called a referendum. This is common in the people's government. So, you have won 2-3 times now. If you come to the congress, will you get a good opportunity? Whether we get an opportunity or not, depends on the people. People can do whatever they want. The decision of the people is the last. If people say that they want to join the congress, then I am joining. They can vote. What can we do? What is ours? Sir, you are saying the same thing. I have never said this to anyone. You are not voting for the king. I have never said this to anyone. So, in the case of you voting, you have tried to convince the people that you have come. Whoever has convinced, we are fine. In politics, there will be a disagreement. After coming, I have gone to decide the people of my area. I will not blame anyone. They are fine. I will not blame anyone. They are fine. They were in the election. You are the chief leader. Yes, I am the chief leader. After the disagreement, I will go to the king. Thank you."

 if you have the power in Karakapuram, then come and contest in Jharki valley. MLCS Ravi has put a question to the death car in Devanahalli. I will release it after a short interview. There is a good road from Belgaum, there is a good car. Anyone can come and contest. Who is not interested in standing in the middle of the road? 224 Kshetra, anyone can contest anywhere. Devanahalli's representative S Ravi has taken up the challenge. In these 224 Kshetra, not only Ramesh Jharki, but all the people, even the people of Tamil Nadu have come to contest in Kanakapuram and Devanahalli. Who told them not to come and contest? If they had the power, they would have come and contest. You are doing a bad thing. Oh no, Swamy, who am I to do a bad thing? I am a free India, a democracy. What is good is that there is a road, there is a good high class road, there is a car. Come and stand in the middle of the road. People should not go up and down."

 The operations that are happening in the elections are getting more and more intense. This is the idea of a Jigio Veerar, who is planning to move from one political party to another. Jumping stars. DK Shivakumar has planned to operate the JDS Abhyarathi. This is a mega plan to destroy the JDS Bhadrakoti. Let's do a little analysis. This is a clean sweep of the district for the political strategists. Which district? Who is that Abhyarathi? How did this JDS Bhadrakoti get destroyed? Some Abhyarathi's are sitting on the wall as if the elections are coming. Where should they jump? They feel that the situation is favorable for everyone. They go there and claim their chance. This is one side. Another side is that the political parties are trying to show the Abhyarathi's who are not good enough. This is the second case. This is a matter related to the Kolarakshetra. The Kolarakshetra is showing the abhyarathi's who are not good enough. DK Shivakumar is planning to do a talk show with the JDS Abhyarathi. On one side, Siddaramaiah is confirming that he is planning to do a show in both the districts. On the other side, CM Srinath is planning to contact the JDS Abhyarathi. This is the story of the Congress Abhyarathi in Kolarakshetra. DK Shivakumar is planning to do a talk show with the JDS Abhyarathi. CM Srinath is getting excited by the talk show. Siddaramaiah is giving a message that he will contest from the Kolarakshetra. But, he is saying the same thing as the High Command. He is saying the same thing as the High Command. The operation Abhyarathi is discussing the strategy of Sidhu Solis. What will happen? Will it be a support? Or will it be an understanding politics? We don't know what will happen. Let's get into the details. Our Political Bureau Head Maruti Pawar's News Desk is with us. Maruti, it is okay to call to ask for support. It is okay to fix a match. Siddaramaiah is talking to the CM. But, he is talking about the contest. What does this mean? Abhishek, the fact that Siddaramaiah is contesting from Varanasi... ...is a fact that he is contesting in Varanasi. It is a fact that he is contesting in Varanasi. There is another thing that he has heard. The Kolarakshetra and Badamiya are still fighting. But, in the occasion of Siddaramaiah's talk with the CM... ...he said that he has decided to contest in two constituencies. The Congress I-Command has agreed. But, he has said that he will contest in two constituencies. On one hand, Siddaramaiah has not struggled... ...with the Kolarakshetra and Badamiya. On the other hand, the Congress I-Command has not given... ...the opportunity to Siddaramaiah to contest in two constituencies. Along with that, the KPCC CM D.K. Shukumar... ...and the ACC CM Mallikarjan Karge... ...have expressed their opinions that one ticket is enough for each. Now, a lot of people are saying that no one should give two tickets... ...or give the opportunity to contest in two constituencies. This is happening in the Congress. Along with that, the KPCC CM D.K. Shukumar... ...is giving the popular candidates to the Congress. Along with that, he is calculating the popular candidates. He is doing a job of contacting the candidates... ...whether they are the former or the current politicians. It is a common question that... ...a politician like that has been done in Kolara district. According to the information we have... ...the Kolara committee has found that... ...the JDS candidate has spoken to CM R Srinath... ...and D.K. Shukumar. That too, at one time... ...before the operation of the candidate... ...has been done. It is a miracle. In Kolara, the JDS candidate has been there. If the candidate has been there twice... ...the individualism of the community will be more. So, if the candidate has been there for five years... ...and has been working for a long time... ...then the candidate can be a plus for the Congress. So, the question is, what has he done to the candidate? But, the threat of this... ...is being discussed in Sidhram's own words. There is a rumor in Congress... ...that if the Congress can't find the candidates... ...then the other parties can't find them. This time, to find Sidram... ...a team is working. They are trying to find the candidates. If D.K. Shukumar has spoken in favor of the other party... ...or if he has done this to the candidate... ...there is a rumor in Sidram's own words. But, Sidram has given an advice... ...that if the candidate has been there twice... ...then the candidate can be a plus for the Congress. But, there is a rumor in the Congress... ...that if the candidate has been there twice... ...then the candidate can be a plus for the Congress. D.K. Shukumar is saying this to the Congress... ...that the candidate can be a plus for the Congress. So, there is a rumor in D.K. Shukumar's words... ...and there is a threat in Sidram's words. We have to wait and see if the Congress will do the I-command. Thank you. Maruthi Pawakada. D.K. Shukumar is saying that he has spoken to CMR Srinath. There is no clarity on the reason for this. If we observe the speed of the former CM HD Kumar Swamy... ...in targeting and taunting the opposition parties... ...if it is true that D.K. Shukumar has approached CMR Srinath... ...or if there are such claims... ...then the reaction should have been there. Let's see what D.K. Shukumar says. Niharajanapada"

 We don't need any alliance. Congress party will in its own. I am expecting two-third majority. Rahul Gandhi is coming on May -- April 5th. [Speaks in Hindi] He's not cared about whether it's disqualification or jail or bail or anything. Without Gandhi family, Congress party will not be united. Without Congress party, country can't be united."

 Siddharaman has already decided on Varunakshetra. He has already decided on two more places. It is clear that his members are also aware of this. Today, there was a high drama. The officials and leaders started announcing that it is done. The people of Surjevala who were there in the meeting were shocked by the announcement. Not only the people of Surjevala, the leaders of the people of Surjevala also got shocked. Siddharaman also joined the meeting during the official announcement. He said that he has not decided yet. He asked the people to sit down and call them. He asked them to call them and asked them to do something. The officials were so excited and were shouting. They wanted to give tickets to Siddharaman in Kolar and contest him. In the previous meeting, we saw such a high drama. Rajendra Simha will give more details about this. Rajendra Simha, we have heard that Siddharaman is trying to make a difference in the election. He said that he will vote for his family and his supporters. It is clear that he has voted for his supporters in this social event. What happened after that, Rajendra Simha? Malathi, the important thing is that Siddharaman has been voting for Kolar since the beginning. But in the first round of the Congress election, Siddharaman has said that he will win Kolar by winning the second place. The message that Surjewala has sent to the High Command is being conveyed by Siddharaman and the people of Kolar. So, what happened in the previous meeting of Sathyamev Jayate, in the meeting where Surjewala was about to give a speech, Siddharaman said that he will contest Kolar and he made a statement. In this situation, Surjewala went to the prayer room. In this situation, Siddharaman took out his mic and did the work that was there. I have not yet given my opinion to the High Command. If I get a vote from there, I will contest Kolar. I have said that everyone should be satisfied. I have satisfied the people there. But no one has spoken to Siddharaman. At this moment, Siddharaman has said that he will contest Kolar. I have made a statement to make a statement. In this situation, the people there, the rulers, all of them have satisfied the people there. There is no use. I have made a statement. Thank you, Rajendra Simha."

 My studios of Republic TV, it's time for Arnab Goswami on the debate. Arnab Goswami on the debate at 9. Presented by Amity University, powered by RP Sanjeev Goenka Group and Panasonic, co-powered by IndusInd Bank and Havells fans. Good evening and welcome. The Karnataka elections have been announced today and result day is the 13th of May. Statistically, the dice is loaded against the BJP. And that is because for over 35 years, the last 35 years, no party has been voted back. No party. So if the BJP manages to come back, either on its own or in a coalition, it will be breaking that 35-year record. Each time it changes, each time it's a toss between the BJP on one side, Congress on the other, BJP one time, Congress the other time, in every election. This is the history of Karnataka politics. Once this side, the next time the other side. But then this time is different. This time it's heading towards a general election that the BJP and the Modi-led campaigns attempt to do a hat trick at the national level. So this time the Karnataka election is not just any other Karnataka election. What is my view? Well, my view is clear. It will be close. And whoever the JDS ties up with, that is whoever H.T. Kumaraswamy ties up with, will form the government. As of now, that is my view. Let's see how the campaign develops. Now Kumaraswamy has been technically against the BJP. He's also technically against the Congress. But the fact is he will be open to whoever offers him the better political deal. But there is another factor. The state government in Karnataka, the BJP government, has been on the back foot on corruption. With charges of corruption and commission plaguing the party. Basavaraj Boma is trying very hard to change that but it may have been too late. Let's see. So it's going to be one hell of a fight. Like Himachal, the Congress party has the upper hand clearly historically. This is therefore the Congress party's election to lose. And tonight on the debate, as usual, back with the biggest newsmaker. We have the Chief Minister of Karnataka joining us in a couple of minutes. We have a Karnataka cash shower controversy. The allegation of the Congress is throwing money literally and Basavaraj Boma is joining me. And ladies and gentlemen, debate number two at 10 o'clock tonight. It's just embarrassing and shameful that this man, Amrit Pal, fugitive terrorist, is putting out video after video and you know he still can't be caught. Unbelievable. That's debate number two and here are the headlines. This is Wednesday evening on the debate tonight. The dates are out. The countdown begins. The Karnataka vote is on the 10th of May. The results are on the 13th of May. From cash stash to cash showers and political rallies, the controversies begin in Karnataka. I was on the top. So I just tried to drop that, drop that money. Could not transfer. I did not have the connectivity. He tries to explain why he was throwing cash at voters. Will corruption decide who wins this election? The Karnataka Congress chief says the cash shower is just a ritual. Ten days on and the entire Punjab police force is looking for him. But Amrit Pal is mocking the entire system. The Khalistani backer releases a video from his hideout, calls for support and mobilization and challenges the government of Punjab. Golden Temple fortified, hundreds arrested, but Amrit Pal is free. Who is helping and aiding him? Big debate on that at 10 o'clock tonight. And the big story this evening. Ladies and gentlemen, the Karnataka elections are as of today, 42 days away. In 45 days, on the 13th of May, we will know who will win the state of Karnataka. But what is clear to all of us is that corruption is the dominating issue in the state of Karnataka. We have a big debate. Take a look. Then we go straight to the debate. A bus in Mandya as part of Congress Praja Dvani Yatra is DK Shivkumar. Congress workers and artists surround the bus. And then DK Shivkumar bends down, reaches for something, pulls up notes, flings them. It's a cash shower during a poll campaign. This cash shower resulted in an immediate response from the BJP. He does everything. He blatantly misuses all kinds of powers and he does everything and he blames us. That has been his. What do I mean? He is like that. People know that's why they are going to reject him. By throwing notes, they are showing that people are beggars. They think Congress party thinks people are beggars. People will teach him. People are the real owners. The Karnataka Congress president has dismissed the charge. We have not offered any money to any voter. As an Indian custom, tradition for the folk and for the women who give the tilak, we just give them some small tips to them. That is our tradition. I was on the top. So I just tried to drop that, drop that money. Could not transfer. I did not have the connectivity. Some two thousand rupees or something to four of them. I just because a lot of women was there putting tilak and flock artists were there. I'm not a fool. I'm also a matured political leader. I know what is my responsibility. The Vadra Congress is leveling corruption charges against the BJP in Karnataka. We are winning this election. People of Karnataka are fed up of the 40 percent government. People of Karnataka are fed up of the BJP playing the caste politics. They're fed up of the caste culture and being turned to suit only for the elections. Unemployment is at its highest. The cash for jobs, scams have been hit. You know how it is in Karnataka. People are fed up. This time it's going to be Congress all the way. The Election Commission, while announcing dates, has already raised alarm over the cash being used in the next election. All enforcement agencies, we have said that there is an absolute strict vigil. You have to have all movement of any kind of material which can induce the elections and fairly. And I'll show you what has happened. We are strengthening our teams in Karnataka to curb the misuse of money power. From 1,900 in 2018, we are increasing to 2,400. Bribery charges are flying thick and fast. There is a 40 percent government. And they know it themselves. Each MLA gets 8-8 crore rupees. They don't take action. They make a small opposition group this big and call for a heady. With 42 days to polling, who will the cash charges hit the hardest? Let's debate. And it's an incredible fight that he is in. And the Chief Minister of Karnataka, Basavraj Bommai, is with us on Republic this evening. Mr. Bommai, I hope you can hear me. This is Arnab here. Yeah, yeah. I'm hearing you, Arnab. Well, I mean, you know, the dates are announced. They say that, they say that, they say statistically, it is impossible for the BJP to come back to power because for 37 years, no party has returned to power. So they say the statistics are stacked against you. Look here, Bharatiya Janata Paksha and the leadership of our Honorable Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji has broken the past records, past statistics. And now for the last nine years, BJP governments have been repeated in different states, most of the states. So the trend is pro-incumbency rather than anti-incumbency. And we are seeking vote through our works, through our projects and through our welfare schemes for the poor and downtrodden. Therefore, I am quite confident and sure that we are going to come back this time with a complete clear thumping majority. Or do you worry that it might be a repeat of Himachal Pradesh, where there is also a similar trend where no political party wins a successive mandate? Now in Karnataka, no political party has won a successive mandate since 1985. See there are other good examples. In Assam, in Tripura, we have reputed. I'm not talking of Gujarat. Gujarat is a special case. But in most of the cases where there was always a reverse trend, we have made it good and we have come back to power there. So we are going to change the records. But in Assam, in Assam after Tarun Gogoi, there has been no big, very big Congress leader. But in Karnataka, you have, you have your favorite, your friend DK Shiv Kumar. You have Siddharam Maya. Don't you consider them Modi opponents? See both Siddharam Maya and DK Shiv Kumar have got a very big baggage, baggage of their past politics. One has got a baggage of corruption where there are a lot of cases against him and there are already running cases against him. And another has got a baggage of supporting PFI for the vote politics and baggage of splitting the Lingayat religion. So they have got a very, very bad track record and people have rejected them. What about your baggage? They say, they say we don't have baggage. They say the BJP has baggage. Basavaraj Bommai was brought in to change that, but the BJP has too much baggage. They have put up pay CM posters, pay MLA posters following the cash recoveries in the house in this from the son of a BJP MLA. So you know, they say that you are the one. The feeling is that you are the one on the back foot on issues of corruption, Mr. Bommai. No, I am not on the back foot. In fact, we are on the forefront. I have brought Lokayakta with full powers. They had really made Lokayakta defunct and they had the ACB, which was a puppet under the chief minister. And I have brought the Lokayakta back because we are for the cleaning of the whole system and we have not supported our MLA was done wrong. He has been arrested also. That shows that we are against corruption, irrespective of the party of ruling or opposition. Do they have the good guts? When Siddharth was the chief minister, there was cash found in the minister's office in Vidhan Sardar. What happened to that case? They buried it under the carpet. What moral right they have got? Therefore, I have got 101 cases against them booked and they have to face the inquiry now. They say that you are not in a position to ask these questions. They say that this is a 40% government in Karnataka. There are allegations by the state contractor's association about 40% commissions being taken in. They said first, BOMAY must clear that issue before he questions us. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have, first thing I have challenged that contractor association, which is a very small association of BBMP. And I said, come out with one case of 40%. Come out with one case. They are unable to come. They want to make a smear campaign, just repeating the lies many times. They think that it will stick. It has not stuck with the public. Similarly, I have booked a case against them in the very BBMP, the very contractors have given 60, 70% premium for the works. Therefore, they are under the back foot as far as 40% is concerned. They are unable to give one case against that. But may I tell you one thing, sir? You got to be a little open about this to me. Do you have an agreement for a post-poll alliance with the JDS? The rumor is that you have already got an arrangement and an understanding with Kumaraswamy and that you will, either which way you will form the government together. Yeah, I want to be very categorically clear that no sort of arrangement with any party including JDS. And in fact, there is a rumor that there is a tact understanding between Congress and JDS. They had one round of talk. They are going to have another round of talk. And our very, very strong leader, Amit Shah himself has said that no question of any kind of adjustment to JDS. We are going to fight our own battle. I'll record this and play it for you in case you change your mind after 13th of May. Certainly, you can. You'll say you won't tell me then the situation was different and I had to. No, no, I'll not give excuses. You're saying you will not be chief minister again if it is with JDS support. No question of having alliance with JDS. Not even. Whether I become, whether I become, I repeat as a chief minister or not, that is left to the party and there is, as far as my party is concerned, it is very clear. Then our policy is also very clear that there will be no talk with JDS of any sort. The Congress said you made a mountain of a molehill today from, about DK Shivkumar. I'll show the pictures again. They say Basavaraj Momai has run out of issues. Mr. DK Shivkumar was only following a ritual. He was giving one, one or two rupee notes, 500 rupee notes to artists following an Indian tradition. He was not bribing voters. That is the picture viewers. Basavaraj Momai, chief minister of Karnataka says today, he says that DK Shivkumar is trying to, he thinks the people of Karnataka are beggars. But DK Shivkumar says I was not trying to bribe voters. Basavaraj Momai does not understand Indian tradition. I was just giving, it's a way I could not reach down. That's why I put a 500 rupee note from top. You're smiling Mr. Momai. That doesn't seem like a lot of money. Why would he want to bribe voters this way? It is not a question of quantum of money. The way the Congress KPCC president treats the people, even if it is a ritual, there is a method to give it. You can't throw the notes on the faces of the people. And that is not our Indian culture. We value the money, whatever the denomination is. And this has been not first time. These people have done such acts so many times. So they don't care for money because they have got to fill the money, filled up in all the apartments. So they don't care for it. That's why I said my people are not beggars. The way they are giving money is that somebody is giving money to the beggars. But do you mean what you're saying? You also need to answer some serious questions on allegations of facilitating or remaining mute spectator when senior party leaders indulge in activities which can be called cash showers. What about the fact, Mr. Chief Minister, that ex-BJP minister Ramesh Jadikoli was accused of offering 6000 rupees per vote? Should the BJP not clarify in extreme specificity of what internal probe? What is allow me to complete? What is the internal probe you did on this charge that Ramesh Jadikoli was offering 6000 rupees per vote? What action did you take on it? It's a very good question. When you had mentioned that we are going to give 6000 to the poor people once we are elected, the similar offer the Congress has done that they are going to give 3000 every family every month. So it is like a similar promises. Nothing to do with cash. And these people have misconstructed it and shown you as if Ramesh Jadikoli is offering cash. In fact, their very own leaders have been caught with giving pressure cookers and a lot of things. These people have been caught. But haven't you also, but haven't haven't haven't there been reports that certain ministers in Karnataka were giving journalists some boxes along with Diwali boxes with some currency notes inside the suites or something like that? No, no, no, no. I'll tell you that's absolutely lie. Second thing is there is one MLA from Bangalore who gave televisions. He has given more than 30,000 televisions to every house and says that I'm giving for children education. Is it not a very, very clear blatant? Which MLA? He is a from the constituency. Is a congressperson. He is a congress MLA. Now, I don't know how do you believe that? How can you really think anybody has any MLA has that kind of money to be distributing 30,000 television sets? Now come on. That's a that's a that's a that's a 30,000 television sets. 30,000 television sets is a lot. Even if I say that each set would be, say, 10,000 rupees, that is 30 crores. Are you saying an MLA is distributing TVs worth 30 crores? Do you believe that? Yeah, already already done. And he has done it openly. Nothing to hide there. It is there to see because that kind of money there, they fill the money. These people have ruled this Karnataka for last 60 years. But Mr. Mumbai, you're being aggressive here today. The Congress Party says, how does Basavaraj Mumbai ask us about corruption? They are saying they are saying that the BJP has already admitted the government was corrupt and is asking for a second chance. It was no. Are you asking for us? First of all, is it true? Is it true, Mr. Mumbai, that the BJP says, OK, this government, they may have been corruption next time. They won't be is that that kind of admission the party has made? No, nobody has made that kind of admission. It's once again a smear campaign done by the strategist of Congress Party is a part of their strategy. We are not said that we are corrupt government and we are cleaning the whole system. That's why we brought in Lokakhta back. Otherwise, I would not have done it. No, but, you know, Mr. Mumbai, no political party, I repeat again, has won a successive mandate since 1985. You know, Mr. Mumbai, there are some things you can't change. History you can't change. You are pitted against history. You are facing incumbency. You are facing incumbency. Some there are charges of corruption against your government. Can you really undo all this in the limited time that you have? The campaign would have started now very soon. It's already in the heat of the campaign. Yeah, yeah, we are in the heat of the campaign. I agree. The track record of government is not that governments are not reputed. Governments have been reputed from 72 and once again 78 under Devrajars and 83 and 85 against Ram Krishna Hegde. So there are results who have been reputed. So we are going to have that kind of a record where there will be reputed and pro-incumbency votes we are going to seek. Is this you versus Rahul Gandhi this time? Because Rahul Gandhi apparently is going to do another Padyatara right now from Kolar, the place where he made the comment against which has landed him in trouble in the defamation case. So he's going to go to Kolar and start a campaign there. So is it you versus who? Is it you versus Rahul Gandhi? I am not going to say that whether Rahul Gandhi is so important for Karnataka. Are you saying he's not important? Yes, it doesn't matter. He has been campaigning for Karnataka three, four elections and whichever constituency he has gone, Congress has never seen the light of the day. So it is not against Rahul Gandhi. You are against whom? Are you against H.D. Kumaraswamy? Are you against? Okay, I'll give you four choices. I'll give you four choices. I'm answering you. No, you're avoiding. You're avoiding. Mr. Bhopal, I'm an experienced journalist. I know when you are a person like you, you are avoiding. No, no question of avoiding. Listen to me. Then you can conclude that whether I'm avoiding. I am against three people. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. I am against the people who have been campaigning for Karnataka. Mr Bommai is very respected, Arnab. Arnab, we are good friends off when it is not election. But Arnab, we are very good friends with Mr Bommai when it is off election. But when it comes to election, we will definitely fight with Mr Basavaraj Bommai also Arnab. Because we are here to form the government of JDS. We are not there to support Mr Bommai. We will definitely ensure Mr Bommai and his party. Ok, we will begin the debate. Can I say thank you to Mr Bommai first. Mr Bommai, let me say one thing to you. You seem, you know, when you came as Chief Minister, many people felt that you are a genial person. You don't look that aggressive. But you seem quite aggressive. Let's see what happens. -No. I am, this is a level of confidence I have. -Yeah. And as far as Sunil is concerned, it doesn't cost anybody to dream. So, let them dream. -Let them dream. Ok. I would say that you are trying to climb Mount Everest without oxygen which is difficult but not impossible. Mr Basavaraj Bommai, thank you very very much. Thank you. -Thank you. -Thank you. Thank you. Ok. That's an interesting chat. What did you think of that? Tanvir Malavika, you heard him here. I will do anything but I won't tie up with Kumaraswamy. I will do anything. He is categorical. You see, Mr Professor Vaidyanathan, he is not even, he is not pussyfooting around the question. He is clear. Categorical. Get it straight. -Straight. He called it straight. -Tanvir to Mr Kumaraswamy. -Tanvir is disappointed because he wanted to be kingmaker. There won't be a reason to. -Arnab, Arnab. -Yes. -Malavika is, Malavika, let us really understand one thing. Dreams are delectable but reality is quite harsh. Mr Basavaraj Bommai who has really spoken his heart out today. Yeah, he has actually. -Actually he knows well within that this is the last time BJP is coming to power here in Karnataka. This is absolutely last time. -So you, thank you. -Because they also, this time also they will come to power right way. Yes, we will return with a bang. We are on a winning streak whether it was in UP or in Gujarat and it's going to repeat in Karnataka. Thank you Tanvir for conceding. -After what you have done. -Thank you for conceding. -Killing youth aspirations. -You just conceded. Dividing society, communalizing everything, communalizing everything. -Oh indeed. -And you still expect that you are going to come back to power. Rich, rich coming from a family party. -Karnataka which was a safe heaven for people to enrich. -Tanvir are you also part of the, are you also part of the family? Because of you, your government, your misgovernance we have lost so much of an opportunity for Karnataka. -Tanvir are you part of the Devegoda family? You have ruined Karnataka. -I am surprised you are here. -And still you have an audacity to come here on national television and represent BJP. You have an audacity to come here and represent BJP. -It is my party I shall represent. -Malavika, you need to really understand this is not a platform. This is not a platform. You have really divided Karnataka because of you Karnataka is a sample. -We lost all of that. We lost all of that. -Wake up from your slumber dream. -Are you part of the Devegoda family? Why are you here? Nobody other than the family is allowed. -I just, I just, one good point here. -I am part of Karnataka family. I am part of Karnataka family. I am part of Karnataka family. -But you are not part of the Gowda family. -And I want my Karnataka to really prosper. The Karnataka which all the Ranna, Pampa. -Louder. Can't hear him. Audio went off. That part, not your Karnataka which you have divided by Karnataka. You absolutely have no right to really speak about Karnataka. Karnataka is something what Coimbatore dream. Do you know what Coimbatore's dream was? -We are in government. We are in government and we are returning. Do you know what was Basavanna's dream? Kalabheda, kolabheda, usiya nudiyalu bheda, thanna bhanna sabheda. Tanvir. -Don't really speak about me. -Tanvir, you know how much Kannada I know. Let's not get there. -That is the understanding of Kannadiga's was. Tanvir, you know how much Kannada I know. Let's not even test each other on this. -No, we have already gone there. We have already gone there. And you know that. -Gone where? -Balvikar deep within me also want BJP to be defeated. Because you are a very nice Kannadiga. -Quit your rhetoric. Let's come to the subject. -The subject is this. Okay. Okay. One point is, one point is I saw these pictures today. I saw these pictures today. And Mohan, they say that this is not an attempt to bribe voters. But tell me, what do you call when a politician like D.K. Shukla Kumar takes wads of cash and tries to throw it up from top of a bus. If that is not an attempt to bribe voters, then what is? You saw the video? Mohan? -I would like to believe D.K. Shukla Kumar on this one, Abba. Because you know, I think he is playing to cherish. He is well known that he has got a lot of money. And if he really wants to give money, I mean you see him giving much more money to everybody. Not throwing a few knots. Alright? Because let's understand, the Karnataka election is going to be a money election. Everybody is going to spend huge amounts of money. I heard some absurd numbers from people as to what they are going to spend. -What numbers are you hearing? All parties. All parties together. All parties, all candidates, they want to win the election. Including the JDS, including BJP, including Congress. I am going to spend a huge amount of money. There are two states in India where a lot of money is going to be spent. That is Tamil Nadu, you know what happens. Where they openly buy people. And Karnataka, they are going to do a lot of things. We saw one MLA, he is a lot of pressure cookers. -Audio please fix. -He also said that TVs have been given. Yeah, lot of things have been given. Lot of things will be given. I hope the EC will demonstrate how they are going to tackle money forward in elections in Karnataka. I mean the EC said we are going to have 2400 people. It's not enough. We must have 10,000 people all over Karnataka to make sure that money doesn't… Are you saying corruption is not an issue, professor Vaidyanathan? Is corruption not an issue, professor Vaidyanathan? Oh gosh! Corruption is not an issue you are telling. That will be the biggest humor or joke for, you know. I would squarely blame the election commission. Election commission has become impotent, totally irrelevant and I really miss Seshan. He would turn blue in his grave. Unfortunately he was not buried, he was burnt. What is the election commission doing? In a meet and poll in Tamil Nadu, it started in 2009 in a place near Madurai, Tirumangalam. That's called Tirumangalam formula. Azhagiri who is the eldest son of Karnanidhi, they openly bribed the people. Now Karnataka, Congress is bribing people, they are claiming post election. If you get into power, we will give you this, we will give you that and other thing. This is a big deal and pre-election money is distributed like anything. In Erode East openly money was distributed. It was even photographed. It came in videos. What did the election commission do? Nothing. I would squarely say our election commission has failed. It has to get lost. We require to have a Seshan type commission. One point is Mr. Professor Vaidyanathan. Anup, you were in Times Now. You remember from that time onwards every alternate Friday DK Subbukumar was ridden. Not now. When you were in Times Now, you had the thing to call me as a panel. At Times Now onwards, if it is alternate Friday, ride DK Subbukumar. Go to his house and then… But what has it really yielded? What has it come down to? What has been achieved? These are cases which have been hanging. Hanging what? These will never be solved. This is an understanding among all these leaders. No, what do you mean understanding? Understanding between which leaders? All the three party leaders. Absolutely there is no doubt about it I am telling you. You are saying they are playacting. You are saying Congress, JDS, BJP all are in cahoots with each other on the issue of corruption at one level. All the political… You tell me in case the JDS, that gentleman is here, if they are going to be the balancing factor, are they going to initiate strict action against either the BJP leaders or Congress leaders? It's not going to happen. It's a sort of what you call in the UP parlance Noor Kushti. Playacting. Noor Kushti. You know WWF that… Noor Kushti sir, it is not Noor Kushti. It is absolutely no Noor Kushti sir. It is going to be a Kushti which is going to be decided. It is Greco-Roman Kushti. No, no, sir, all that rhetoric I have heard from 1975, your man was chief minister for one full term. JDS was chief minister for one full term. I am giving you the data. I am giving you the data. Kumar Sabin was the chief minister or not? Sir, we have served Karnataka for 31 years. Do you know Janata Party has served 31 years in Karnataka? No, in the middle. Fortunately, your party is a balancing party. No, no, this is a very interesting spin. No, no, very interesting spin. And may I say this, may I say this, may I say this, have you noticed, you see, whether you like him or not Mohan, as we know Prof. Vaidyanathan for quite some time, the man shoots from the hip. I have disagreed with him on many things. On even his economic views sometimes I don't agree. But I noticed something Kamru that when he was speaking, Mohan, all the three parties were listening quietly. And it is a sentiment. There are people responding. As of this minute from Karnataka who are saying that what he is saying is correct. There is an implicit understanding between the political parties of Karnataka. I was listening out of respect for Prof. Vaidyanathan. Now don't read it as… No, maybe in silent agreement. I was just listening out of respect. What Prof. Vaidyanathan said is very unfortunate considering the context in which elections are taking place in India right now. You know, let me finish ma'am, one second please. Basically what Prof. Vaidyanathan is suggesting that all the parties in the fray in Karnataka are corrupt and money power will be used. Even the election commission has suggested to it. Now as far as Congress is concerned, let me just point out to you, we have got a BJP government in place in Karnataka. The administration is run by the BJP. The police machinery, state machinery is with the BJP and now controlled by the election commission. You have got the central forces will be coming in for the Karnataka elections. That also not under the Congress regime. Now if any leader of the Congress party is forming… The code of conduct is in place as of today. What is he saying? They can easily be isolated and they can easily, the law will take its course. There is nothing to be hidden from you. You never use these words on my program, law will take its course. I hate, that line doesn't make sense. Don't use that word. Don't use that cliche here. In this context, I am clarifying, in this context I don't like that word. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, my question here is… What is the source of that money? Where was it going to be used? Any debate on that? No, you will not go into that debate. May I answer? No, no, one minute, one minute. One minute, one minute, he has asked me. How the other lands up with the BJP? He has asked me. He has asked me. I think the last party which should speak about corruption is Congress. Mr. Kamru, last party which should speak about corruption is Congress. On that we all agree. We all have a good laugh on that. On that we all agree. I agree with you on that. I agree with you. Finally I agree with you my friend. The last party which should speak about corruption is Congress. Please don't speak about corruption. You know everybody, ok, in Ramanagara one candidate… You have brought in the 2G scam. You have brought in the… No, one candidate in Ramanagara, Mr. Yadav. One minute, one minute, one minute. Ok, ok, viewers, just pause for a minute, pause for a minute. Tanvir, Tanvir, Tanvir, pause for a minute. I know he has entertained you a lot. You know, you know, I find this remarkable. Whenever a Congress leader talks about corruption, people are quiet for 30 seconds and they all burst out laughing. What were you saying, Mohan? Anna, I once asked a very, very senior member of a political party, highly respected person, why do you give money to corrupt candidates? He told me very simply, my son, do you give money to me to run my party? I need money to run my party. Nobody gives me money. So I give seat to very corrupt people who give me a lot of money to run the party. The tragedy of politics is none of us give money to political parties to run their party and the elections. You know, a seat will cost you 5-10 crores just to campaign. Please understand. And cannot I get the restate? And many candidates are telling me they will spend anywhere between 10-30 crores for every seat. I don't know whether it's true because I've got no evidence. This is based on what I've heard from many people. Mr. Mohan Rajpai, please wake up. There is one candidate in Chikpet who has already spent 100 crores. I can't believe it. One candidate who has already spent 100 crores. One minute, one minute. These are remarkable comments. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, Malavika, Malavika, why are you on the defensive? Why are you on the defensive? He said there is one candidate who has spent 100 crores. Why are you on the defensive? I am on the defensive. What is he saying? How does he account for 100 crores being spent? Malavika, is that… -He should be talking of that senior leader who spoke of paying candidates or receiving money from candidates. I think Mr. Pai was suggesting to his party, Supremo. Were you not, Mr. Pai? -Oh! They are the ones who take money against issuing tickets. The BJP doesn't do all that. You are saying Kumaraswamy sells tickets? -It's very expensive. -One minute. You are saying Kumaraswamy sells tickets? One minute, one minute. This is big. Malavika says that Kumaraswamy is selling tickets. Tanvir is responding. Malavika deserves a ticket from Jainaga just because she doesn't have money. Her party doesn't give her a ticket. Malavika, please tell. -Tanvir, Tanvir, thank you for your nip slip. I don't need it. I will… Tanvir, thank you for your nip slip. -Malavika, we know how much you struggle. How much you struggle. The only criteria BJP rejected your candidature is because you don't have money. This debate is not about me. -That's all. You have all the capabilities. You are very vocal. Tanvir, this debate is not about me. -You are a thinking lady. You are very well famous. I am not walking into your trap. -People in Karnataka love you, respect you. Your husband is very famous. Thank you. -But you don't have money. -Thank you. -That's the reason. Tell me why BJP is not giving you ticket. Don't speak all this Malavika. -No, but… -Tanvir, that's between me and BJP. I don't think you should… -No, but what I find remarkable in this Chandan Gowda is a professor at ISCC in Bengaluru. What I find remarkable in this viewers, if I can just take a pause for a while, that we are on a national channel in one of India's most significant states whose capital is considered the Silicon Valley of the country. And there is an open conversation about the use of money. Nobody is denying it, Chandan. Nobody is even attempting to deny it. It's being taken as a given. -People are not… Chandanikar is very honest. No, no, but it's being taken as a given. An open attempt to buy votes is being taken as a given. Chandan Gowda. Yeah. And you raise an extremely important point because it's become normalized. People think it's going… It's here to stay and let's work with it. And I think it's time for a show like this to actually step back and say, what do we do to make sure it goes away? I mean, it's not like an overnight solution that we're thinking of, but gradual ways of curbing it. And the fact that all parties are corrupt doesn't mean they're all corrupt at the same scale. Some are comfortably corrupt. Some are struggling with corruption. In any case, it's a terrible thing to have to live with. And we have to find ways of getting rid of them. And I don't want to sound like a purist here. We have a body called the Election Commission that has a, you know, 10 lakh ceiling, etc., which gets, you know, spent in the first half an hour of an election campaign. So there's a farcical side to this, which we need to attend to if people are not to become cynical. They've already become cynical. So some hope has to be restored. And how do we curb election expenditure? This is something that we need to put our heads together to think about. Do we have to stop campaigning? Which is the source of big spending is something to think about. -No, but we are here, but we are here tonight is throwing cash, the only way to win the election. Consider this viewers, 45 minutes into this debate, Mohan. And that's the sense I get. 45 minutes into the debate tonight. On a day Karnataka elections are announced, Chandan. No, 45 minutes into a debate, where the chief minister has been there and we have a full debate after that, we still don't know what the issue any political party is principally taking to the voter. Each political party… -No, what is your issue? Each political party is accusing the other of spending more money. Am I right, professor? I think the professor is back now. I think professor Vaidyanathan is back. There is no issue it seems. There is no singular issue on which this election is being fought. Arnab, there is a research study, serious research study that before every poll, the amount of cash withdrawn from all the banks is phenomenally high. Let me repeat it. Before every small poll, interior polls and other things, the amount of cash withdrawn from all the banks, or cash in circulation becomes so large. Why does it so? And cash is carried in police vans, in ambulances, all the places and distributed. It's not something top secret. -Yeah, but professor Vaidyanathan, okay, Malavika said, no, this is not the right impression that you have. There are some issues. Malavika, tell me, besides accusing the other, what is your issue? Forget the whole theory of a double engined Sarkar, we got Mohan back also. What is your issue? If I were to tell you, give the people of Karnataka one reason they should vote for you. The sole issue is development. We are fighting, we fought every election on the basis of the work we have done or the work we are going to do. It has been so, it shall be so. This is a pro-incumbency election that we are fighting based on the work we have done, both in the central government and the state government. That's about it. This show of money, this display of entitlement by Mr. D.K. Shivkumar, his feudalistic attitude of throwing money, not just at voters, but artists. I am more outraged today because I am an artist. Because he's throwing money at people who are performers. What does he think he is? Who does he think he is? This is a show of his entitlement because he draws it from the corruption. Sir, the man has been handed over to the Lokayugda police, the same Lokayugda that you shut shop of. Do you have an answer on that? Why did Mr. Sidhra shut down the Lokayugda? Can you tell me? Just one simple reasoning that I am giving out here, why people should not vote for the BJP. As you asked, you know the BJP changed their chief minister in 2021 on the basic issue of corruption. Because Yadurappa was supposed to be the most corrupt chief minister ever India had. Now you see, Yadurappa… No, he's coming up with his own… -Kamru, Kamru, Kamru, Kamru, Kamru, one minute, I am stopping you there. Kamru, Kamru, Kamru, Kamru, Kamru, qualify that statement one minute. Malavika, Malavika, no, one minute. When you say that Yadurappa was changed on the issue of corruption, you qualify the statement with a fact or a citation. Mohan is there. Tell me, on what basis? Qualify the fact. Give a citation. On what basis? Let BJP say why did they change Yadurappa in 2021 July. Let BJP explain the facts. What we got the impression? The perception was Yadurappa is most corrupt because one of the most corrupt… -No, no, that is whose perception. Mohan, you agree with that? Mohan, you agree with that? -You are openly asking for 40%… -No, no, Mohan, you agree with that? -That carried on today. Sorry, sorry, Mr. No, no. -Otherwise, why would they bring in the hijab issue? Why did they bring in the hijab issue? Mohan, on the other side, Mohan. -Why Ganesh Gupta issue? Why was the reservation of the conflicts? Mohan, okay, I heard you there. I am getting a response. I got two minutes. Mohan and Professor Vaidyanathan. Mohan first. Is that the reason why the change happened? Was that a… -The change happened, the change happened because they wanted to rebuild the leadership for the elections in the state and for the national elections. I think the change happened for various reasons. Because please remember, Yadurappa was a very popular leader in Karnataka. He had popular support. Even today, he is a very tall leader. Whatever you may say about him, he is one of the tallest leaders Karnataka has produced. Like Sri Devya Gowdaji, like Siddharamayaji, S.N. Krishna. Yadurappa is a very tall leader. People respect him. People love him. Yes, there are some charges against him. There are some cases which have to be proved in the court of law. But he is a highly respected, very tall leader and people respect him. People love him and a very decisive leader. I don't know what Kamrup knows about history here. Because Siddharamayaji has been a very good leader for Karnataka. S.N. Krishna has been a very good leader. Bombay has been a very good leader for us. But the fact is, we are a very rich state. And corruption has taken deep roots within Karnataka. It is not party A, B or C. It is a spoils of office for everybody. Because elections cost a lot of money. And none of us give money. Good money is not coming to the political parties. Bad money is coming. And lot of money has to be spent. What do you say? I am not justifying anything. I mean I like the professor talking about principles. But every political party has to spend huge amount of money. There is no denying the fact. There is no denying the fact. -No, one minute. I will just end with a political question. I will end with a political question. I don't want to be theoretical about it. Tanvir. Tanvir. Tanvir. Tanvir. Tanvir. Tanvir. My question is to Tanvir. My question… -Hijab was created by the PFI. Hijab was created by the PFI. The evidence is there. -My question is to Tanvir. -Mohan, there is a question for me. There is a question, very important question for Tanvir which might yield a news point. Tanvir. Tanvir. Tanvir, I just want to ask you, how many seats are you contesting out of how many in Karnataka? How many seats are you contesting out of how many in Karnataka, Tanvir? -We are contesting all, Arnab. 224. We are contesting all 224. -Okay. How many seats did you have the last time? -Arnab, we had 37 seats last time. Okay. So, on a positive estimate you would win about, if you do very well, you will win 50-55 seats which is the general assessment. Which means that you are fighting to be in the opposition. You are fighting the election to be in the opposition. -And Arnab, mission 123 is our mission and we would definitely, we would definitely achieve that mission. Mission 123 is our mission and we would definitely repose our confidence in people of Karnataka. Unlike BJP and Congress, we are really going with pro-program. -Okay. -Kumar Swamy has already visited 100 constituencies and the kind of response we have seen, it is overwhelming. The kind of response Devagoda used to get in 1996 is similar or better response we are getting it. We are very hopeful that we on our own we are going to form the government. Otherwise, we would prefer to sit in opposition, Arnab. Dream on! -Preference. No, no, no. He is not saying we will. I would prefer to. -One point for the viewer. One point for the viewer. -No, he is not. -I have travelled in Eastern UP and Bihar. Poorest places, nobody talks about getting bribe and voting. Poorest are the poor people. When I asked them, will you, if you are given 500 rupees, they were shocked actually. What about our ISAD? The richest state like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, people are bribed and getting voted. This is I think the point you should think of debating. -Well, I think… -Why the poorer segment are not getting… I think it's a, I wouldn't make an assumption that people can be bribed to give their vote. People can try to bribe. That's one thing. I began the program with Basavaraj Boma is saying I won't go with the JDS. I am ending with the JDS saying I prefer to remain in the opposition. The operational word, viewers, please note, both sides are saying we would prefer. Preferences don't matter when the results are out. I thank you very much. And on the other side, viewers, the raging debate across the entire country. Where is Amrit Panth? Now, this is not a question about this individual. He is putting out these videos, Osama bin Laden type from hideouts. But what kind of an institutional collapse are we seeing of the law and order machinery in Punjab and beyond? The entire state government, central government can't catch one fugitive. Back in a few minutes, viewers, the Amrit Pal debate. Please come back. [MUSIC PLAYING]"

 The story between KPCC President DK Shivakumar and Ramesh Jarki Holi is not new. Ramesh Jarki Holi is the one who has taken the responsibility of water supply in the new government. Because, the same responsibility was being held by DK Shivakumar in the previous government. He will take the responsibility and become the minister. In a few days, a CD related to him will be released in the way he has directed. You know the developments after that. He has come to resign from the post of a minister. It's been two years now, but the story of the two of them is still not over. Ramesh Jarki Holi will hold a press meet. He will accuse DK Shivakumar. He will try to take the matter to the CBI. He failed. Today, he has again released big weapons against DK Shivakumar. At the end of the election, the CD is again being blackmailed. The CD blackmail accusation against DK Shivakumar is repeated. Ramesh Jarki Holi has made a direct accusation that DK Shivakumar is blackmailing with some CDs. Ramesh Jarki Holi has a serious charge sheet. Ramesh vs. DK Shivakumar is a game of cards. Who will win in this war? Once, he has come to accuse that he has taken over the post of a minister. Then, the politicians have been discussing this. Why should we interfere? Congress, BJP or JDS, why should we interfere? They have been discussing this. But, this discussion is not stopping. Ramesh Jarki Holi's accusation against DK Shivakumar has entered another level. DK Shivakumar is blackmailing his friends in Bombay. Ramesh Jarki Holi has again made a direct accusation against DK Shivakumar. He has accused DK Shivakumar of having a lot of CDs. He has said this in the morning press meet. He has also said that he has a lot of CDs in his factory. He has used his cutting and pasting technology to blackmail his friends. He has blackmailed his friends in Bombay. He has said that he will release his CDs if he doesn't do this. Ramesh Jarki Holi is saying that DK Shivakumar is blackmailing his friends. Let's see what he has said.

 Namaste, welcome to #AQ. I am your Rajesh. Malik Arjun Karge, who is the AACC Chief Minister and AACC President, is definitely going to have to face the Karnataka elections as a fire test. Is there a chance for Karge to win the Karnataka elections? Even if he wins, it will definitely be a fire test. Because Malik Arjun Karge is the new boss of the Grand World Party, the Congress Party. On the other hand, he is saying that it is a great historical moment for the Congress Party, to become the AACC President. So, many political analysts are saying that this position of being the MP is a sign of his strength. In the assembly elections that took place in the country, even though Karge could not show his influence, he showed his strength in leading the party. On the other hand, in the Congress elections, when he was asked to stand with his mouth shut, he also proved his leadership. Many people are praising Karge for this. On the other hand, he won by bringing all the opposition parties to the same stage. Malik Arjun Karge has also shown his influence in the parliament. He has also taken up the responsibility of leading the Congress Party and Karge. This is a national news. In the same way, the Karnataka Assembly elections are coming up. The parliament elections are coming up next year. Before that, there will be a semi-final test in Karnataka. The Congress Party is saying that it is a test of fire. Malik Arjun Karge is the new boss of the Karnataka Party, who is the new president. There is a possibility that he will win the house elections. There is a suspense and a discussion about whether he will win the house elections or not. May 13th is the day when the results of the elections will be announced. So, there is a possibility that he will win or lose. Karge is a hero. But, the Karnataka and the country will know about it on May 13th. After many days, the Congress Party has come to power. This is the first time that the Karnataka Assembly has come to power. A week ago, the Congress Party released 124 representatives. On the other hand, many politicians are saying that this is a good news for the Congress Party, which has been in the lead since the Nithyam Antarkata War. Many people are saying that the announcement of the first term without any bad opinions is also a hindrance to Karge's behavior. Even when there are bad opinions between the former CM Siddaramayya Prasadam and PCC President DK Sivakumar, many people are saying that this election will be a headache for the Karnataka Congress. On the other hand, Karge is playing a very important role in the party's behavior. Karge, who is known as a non-partisan, has been a partner in the fight since the time when the AACC President was in power. So, he is the one who will announce the schedule. Karge and Siddaramayya Prasadam have won the first term without any bad opinions. Many politicians and Congress Party leaders are saying that if Congress wins the 10th May election, the credit will be theirs. Karge knows very well what kind of situation will be faced by two different parties under the same roof. Karge has closely monitored the problems between them as he is a non-partisan. Karge has solved it personally. Karge has been to MLA's house 9 times. He has never been to the Karnataka CM. He has never been able to stand against the internal war that is going on. He has never been able to stand against the internal war that is going on. On the other hand, in 1999, M.S. Krishna, in 2014, and Dharam Singh in 2013, have not been able to face the tough competition. In 2004, when he was a MLA, he had the opportunity to play a role in the Sankirtan government. In the second term, when he was a MLA, he was able to face the internal war that is going on. He was able to face the internal war that is going on. Karge has been able to face the internal war that is going on. Karge has been able to face the internal war that is going on. Karge has been able to face the internal war that is going on. Karge has been able to face the internal war that is going on. So, this is a great achievement for Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi. Karge has been able to become the king three times. This time, he has been determined to become the kingmaker. He has been determined to win the house and the election. So, he has been focused on the house. In the third of the nation survey, in Karnataka, in January, Lok Sabha elections were held. He has been able to get 17 seats out of 20 seats. I will share the survey report once. Since the day Karnataka was established, the ABP sea water survey or the Taj Agha suicide survey has been said to not win the Congress. It has been said just now that the Congress will lose 127 seats. So, in this election, if it is Karge, it is definitely DK Shivakumar versus Siddharama. There have been many opinions on this from the past. They are both doing a good job. On the other hand, the Karge views are definitely moving fast to steal the people of Karnataka. So, definitely, with Karge's politics, in Karnataka, in the elections, it is clear that Karge is supporting the Congress party. So, it is a real fire test to see whether Karge's politics will succeed or fail in the Karnataka elections. It is clear that it will have to wait till May 13. For more videos, please watch #Astragi"

 What did the dates do for the Congress party? Are you in a huddle now to roll out the second list of candidates? I'm very happy. The election commission has said that one day is good for the Congress party. And a lot of demands were there. They were just trying to loot every day, misuse the government machinery. The earlier the better. Short term for the election preparation, we agree with it. But we have an objection on the 80 years of voting, which has been the oven house. But they will try to misuse the official machinery. We are going to file our objection on that 80 years of age. Because almost 7,000, 8,000 voters-- Nearly 12,000,000. 12,000,000 voters, they want to misuse them using the official machinery. But don't you think it's convenient for them if-- No, no. It may be convenient. But at the same time, they have the government in their hand. It is a caretaker government. They will try to misuse, but we'll be very cautious on this point. Here the election commission has spoken about money bags and warned people flexing with money. There was a video that's come out of yours, throwing some cash at people. Bombay has accused that this is Congress's nature. What would you say? Bombay, I don't know. He has to tell about 8 crores of money seized in his own MLA. That he has to answer. He has not answered. Prime Minister has not answered. He has to answer on 40% commission. He has to answer on PSA scam, which he was the Home Minister. He is the father of corruption in Karnataka. And he and his government, because why they changed the Chief Minister. And one minister has to resign on a bed. One minister has to resign on a corruption. So what more do you need? You don't need any other replies to it. It is the Lokayakta has given a reply. He was asking for us. What is the witness? And the Lokayakta has given a witness to him. So you know, as much as we see that the Congress is now trying hard to make it to the finish point with a win this time, there's talk about who's going to be the CM face. Is DK Shivkumar going to be the CM in Karnataka, if Congress wins? Let us not discuss on the CM. May 10th is a day for a change. May 10th is a day to root out corruption. May 10th is a day for the good governance of Karnataka, for a better Bangalore, for a global Karnataka. And it will be for a change. I think the double engine has failed. And a new engine for a prosperous and a progressive Karnataka will come on May 10th. And I wish that the people of Karnataka will use the new engine. All right, we heard you. But is Congress reverse engineering? Are you trying to forge BJP netas? Bombay says that you're making calls. No, BJP leaders are on the way. A lot of people, they wanted to leave the BJP. They know that the engine has failed, and they're coming. But see, four years, Mr. Puttanna, he's a graduate teacher, conscience, he resigned. Mr. Baburao Chinchissori is a sitting MSC. Like that, sitting legislators who are there, who had the term, have resigned. They feel that they did not get their voice. They did not get their choice. They feel that it is the most corrupt government. They can't face the people of Karnataka with this type of administration. So they all are on the way to join the Congress party. Disqualified Rahul Gandhi is going to come to Kolar for a yatra. Is that going to help? He's been disqualified by the BJP leader. He's not been disqualified by the people of Karnataka or the people of this country. People love him. He has joined the people of this country. And Bharat Jodho, that is the big sense. So he's coming here on 5th April. Satya Meva Jayate rally is going to start. That will be the beginning of the end of Karnataka"

 So thank you for waiting for all of us. You know we all will be in an election committee meeting. I think more or less 60-70% we have all unanimously decided. And rest we will take some time to discuss the other issue. As rightly said, our aim is only to bring Congress Party to power and we will deliver. We will deliver a good government, a government with a governance. We will see that the most corrupt state which has been already given a boon from the BJP will be vanished. I am very happy that all of you are also waiting to have a good beginning at the South India and Congress Party will come to power. We all stand together, we work together, we will bring Congress Party together. I am not upset with anyone. I know what Sidhra Maya Heart is, I know what my heart is, I know what your heart is. We all will win. Our aim is to bring Congress Party and you all have to walk and meet us at Vidhan Sodha. So our heart is clear and so should all of you be. Thank you. News first. Channa."

 BJP Congress is trying to make Halda Mysore a part of the party again. Both the parties have the same goal of destroying the JDS's Badrakota. Yesterday, in Srirangapatna, KPCC leader DK Shivkumar, was welcomed by the public. When he said that he is investing money in women's accounts, the women were overjoyed. Congress is getting a great response. People are giving a big welcome to the leader by planting flowers in JCP. But, will all this change as votes? I don't know. But, in some areas, JDS has to accept Sol. Political discussions are going on. Even in Mandya Hasan. Congress and BJP leaders are getting a great response. DK Shivkumar is also a part of the party. So, we are waiting for the response."

 In 30-40 days, Congress will come to power. After Congress comes to power, we will stop all this. KPCC President DK Shivakumar is asking the government's moustache. Muslims and Hindus are humans, right? Why did you remove the moustache for Alpasankhi Yatra? Lingayats, Vakalis are not beggars. We don't need them. They are raising the issue of moustache on the basis of population. Karnataka Congress DK Shivakumar Veerasevi asked, 17% Vakalai asked. We don't need anything. We are not beggars. Give it on the basis of our population. Why did you remove it for Alpasankhi Yatra? Was it 4%? Was it this much? You are doing enough to make a free map. Then, for those who have made a free map worth 1 crore, for any cost, protest. You are trying to make hatred between each other. Karnataka has a history. This is a peaceful place. In the beginning, we should make our state a part of it. Today, we are doing this. We are doing this as a peaceful place. This is a peaceful history. This is a very important place for the whole world. We should live here, work, and study. Nature is good, the climate is good. The whole world has made Karnataka a developed state. You have voted today to find out this. Congress has taken this decision. It is a decision that should not be ignored. All this is being condemned. After 40 days, Congress government will come to this state. What you have done, you have cancelled it. Congress has taken the decision to give justice to the society. I would like to say this in this context. NEWS FIRST, EVERY MINUTE"

It is not their property. It is their right. The minorities of the soil are living and they have their own rights. We don't want their 4% to be scrapped and given to any of the major communities. The major communities the vakrika, lingais are the people who have been, they are called the annadatas. They plough the land, they give food, they grow, they are the tillers and the landowners. We don't want any of the minorities because they are our brothers and family members. This is a country with all community. Our country is very rich in our culture. All of them are helping us equally. So they have taken their 4% and distributed 2% to lingais, 2% to vakrikas. The entire vakrika and Virashiva lingais are rejecting this offer. We don't want. I am confident the congress party will come to power after the next 45 days. We will scrap all this reservation. Within 90 days, they can't change 3 times. There is no base. There is no any report. No proper inquiry has been done. So politically, they know that this government is full of corruption. They have lost the base. The honorable prime minister, home minister, all of them are coming and staying here only to somehow see that they get back their government. It is impossible they will not get this government. The people of Karnataka have decided to throw this government. Now they are trying to take this in an emotional way. Emotional way will not work. What you give to the people, how you take them, how you take everyone to confidence is very much important. I fully believe that people will reject this.

 Who will become CM if Congress wins in Karnataka? Who will get the high command? Will Siddaramaiah become serious if he gives a hand in the elections? What do the people think? As the assembly elections were postponed, Karnataka went into election mode. The focus of the main political parties shifted to Karnataka state. The MPs of the opposition are protesting on the form of manifesto. But the Congress and BJP are silent on the opposition of the CM. Kamal Hadalam is going to the elections under the leadership of CM Basavaraju Bommai. But the CM seat has become a hot cake in Congress. KPCC Chief D.K. Shivakumar and CLP leader Siddaramaiah are protesting for the CM seat. Siddaramaiah is saying no compromise on the CM seat. He is declaring that he is the CM 100%. He is giving statements that he will be the CM because these are his last elections. For the past 5 years, D.K. Shivakumar is running the Congress party in Karnataka. He is standing as a troubleshooter for the Gandhi family by opposing the Dharayapta organization. D.K. has announced that he will win the Congress and gift Rahul Gandhi. He is encouraging to get the CM seat. But Siddharamaiah's manifesto gave a shock to D.K. Shivakumar. ABC survey also revealed interesting things about the Karnataka CM. When ABP News Sea Water survey was conducted to know who will be the CM, 39.1% voted for Siddaramaiah. 31.1% voted for the current CM Basavaraju Bommai. ABP survey revealed that only 3.2% voted for D.K. Shivakumar. It will take few more days to know who will be the CM and who will be the winner."

 Sidharamaiah's statement is the reason for the discussion in the political arena. The reason for the discussion is the opportunity given to the National Assembly. He himself has given a clarification for this. The statement that D.K.Shi will not become the CM is a question. Or a question that he is being asked. Sidharamaiah has said that he did not say it in that way. He has said that someone has changed his statement. Sidharamaiah has given a clarification that all this is a pure lie. That means D.K.S Shivakumar will not become the CM, I did not say that. That is a pure lie. Sidharamaiah has given a clarification that he has changed his statement. I did not say that. Someone has changed his statement. What I said is that, In the democratic process, The party has changed. They are aspirant, I am also aspirant. You have learnt from the Freedom app and are preparing the salt apple. So, for those who have bought the salt apple for more than 1 crore, For any cost, do the bargaining. That is what he has said. But, I did not say anything else. I did not say that. Someone has changed his statement. What I said is that, In the democratic process, The party has changed. They are aspirant, I am also aspirant. That is what he has said. But, I did not say anything else. To get more details, We have seen the clarification of Jagadish Sidharamaiah. He did not say that he will not become the D.K.C.M. But, he has talked about a procedure. What do you think is the reason for the discussion? The procedure he has talked about, And the message he has given, Are the reason for the discussion. Definitely. Because, to say this to Sidharamaiah, In the context of giving an opportunity in the national media, He has mentioned about the C.M. Who will become the C.M.? Who are the C.M. aspirants? I am also a C.M. aspirant. In the context of that, There is a public government in the Congress party. According to that, No one has been i.q.d. by the government. For such people, there will be a C.M. position. In the High Command, In the public opinion, The internal public opinion, The discussion will be done. That is what he has proposed. The discussion that he has given, Has been rejected by the media. According to Sidharamaiah, In Delhi, he has given a response to the media. What I have said is one thing. But, in the media, The information given by the national media, Is different. It has been rejected. He has created a problem for me. That is what he has said. So, what Sidharamaiah has said, And what he has clarified, In the context of giving an opportunity, In the context of asking a question, The C.M. candidate will come to the question. The C.M. candidate will come to the question. In the context of asking the question of the C.M. candidate, I think Akanksha will say something, In a very bold way. D.K. Shukumar, If the C.M. becomes the candidate, In the context of asking such a question, He says, no one is okay. The government can take any decision. In the highest level, The internal public opinion, The public opinion within the party, Will be taken to the C.M. That is what he says. The same opinion, D.K. Shukumar, In the context of giving a clarification, He has rejected it. Thank you Jagadish for the information."

 The state was conducting an inspection. When will the elections be announced? When will the elections take place? This was a big question. Today, the same time is fixed. The election committee is conducting a purification ceremony. The general election is clear. So, the day of Karnataka elections will be decided. When will the elections take place? The day of the elections is clear. The countdown has begun for the state assembly elections. In the next half an hour, the day of the elections will be announced. The first week of May, the elections are being held for 24 constituencies. The elections are possible in two weeks. In the second week, the elections are possible again. Because the government should be in power by May 22-23. From today, the law will be implemented. The moment the purification ceremony is conducted, the law will be implemented. The moment the announcement is made, the law will be implemented. The count of the constituencies is very high. The elections are possible in two weeks. We will see if it is possible in one or two weeks. The law will be implemented. The moment the announcement is made, the elections are possible. In the first week of May. Because if the result is announced in the second week, the government will be in power by May 22-23. So, in the first week of May, the elections are possible in two weeks. How will it be decided in North Karnataka and South Karnataka? I am telling you the possibilities. It is not possible in two weeks. The possibilities are that it can be done in two weeks. It can be done in one week. If it is done in one state, the possibility is that the law will be implemented from today. It is not a possibility. The law will be implemented. There is no doubt. The result will be announced in the second week of May. So, these are the possibilities. We should help them. We should give power to 200 units of 10 kgs of rice. We should give 2,000 rupees to every girl. We should make an announcement to the youth who are uneducated. We should get a code of event. The government has done everything to weaken the government, the authorities and the machinery. They have done all the illegal activities. How is the reservation court's action going on? The people who are the main ministers of the village, the people who are the backbone of the village, how are they being harassed? You have seen it with your own eyes. No one has a problem. They are harassing the society and doing it against the constitution. If you read any of the court documents, nothing is there. But what did they do? What did they do wrong? I am getting a direct contact with the political expert Ravi Shree. Ravi Shree, since you are in the political bureau, you are the political head, you are doing the calculations in a big way. When will the date be announced? When will the election commission press meet? When will the announcement be made? Finally, that day has come. What next Ravi Shree? The important thing is that everyone can put forward the date. The announcement can be made in April. This and other discussions have started. Because last time, the date was announced on the 27th. Now it has gone two days ahead. The date is being announced on the 29th. So, last time, when we took the calculations, the election was held on 12th May. The counting and all the processes were completed on 15th. So, if the new government is to be established, there is still time for the 23rd. So, all the processes have to be completed by the 23rd. So, the election will be announced on the first week of May. The date will be fixed on the first or second week of May. It will be fixed on the first week of May. So, the first week will be fixed. And on the second week, all the processes will be completed. The counting and all the processes will be completed. Or, the election will be announced on the second week of May. And on the third week of May, all the processes will be completed. So, by the third week, the process of making the elections possible for the people, and for the government to get the opportunity, the discussions will be held on the various aspects. So, the time for the examinations and all the processes will be completed. All the calculations have been taken. The process of making the elections has started. The state tour of three days, was conducted in the presence of the Chief Minister of Central Elections. All the processes have been made. Along with that, the training of the candidates, and the training of the candidates for the elections, has been done in Delhi. Yesterday and the day before, the Chief Minister of Central Elections was present at Assam. It was said that the elections could be announced today or on the 31st. So, it is fixed for the 29th. The election day, the day of the election and the counting day, is a very important day for the people of Karnataka. So, the election committee has made a very important announcement. Okay, we are in touch with Ravi. We will keep you updated. The election announcement is a legal document. From the moment, all the government programs will be suspended. The new programs will not be announced. The Shankhu establishment will not be completed. All government programs will be suspended. Along with that, all the ministers, the governors, the state officials, and the government officials will not be allowed to work. All this will start now. From the moment the election announcement is made, the legal document will be issued. So, the moment the legal document is issued, the programs that will be announced, the religious and caste issues, the programs that will be announced, the Shankhu establishment will not be completed, all of them will be suspended. They will not get any benefits from the government because of the ongoing election process. And if the election is held by them, they will get it later. That's different. Now, they are saying that the new announcements will not be made, the new programs will not be announced, the Shankhu establishment will not be established, and no one will get any benefits. This is after the legal document is issued. The tender is not being called. All the government programs will not be held. They will only do what is necessary. Nothing new will be done. The governors and the state officials will not be allowed to use the government vehicles. The officials will not be allowed to conduct the public program. Along with that, the officials will not be allowed to conduct any other activities. The transfer will be done by the election department. The elected officials will not be allowed to conduct the election. All of this will be done under the legal document. The promotion will not be done, the Shankhu establishment will not be established, the inauguration will not be done, the foundation will not be laid, the association will not be established, the officials will not be established. The election department will do as they say. They will do the same for the citizens. So, all of this is there. My colleague, Ravi Shree, is in direct contact with me from the political bureau. Ravi Shree, in this discussion, where will the election announcement from the moment of the legal document come to pass? For what will there be a break, Ravi? Definitely, during the election and the election process, the legal document will be issued from the moment of the legal document. So, for about half an hour, the time to issue the legal document will be from the moment of the election and the moment of the legal document will be around half an hour to one hour. The legal document will be issued in the state. Because, whatever programs are being done, those programs will be there. That is, the half-time workers will be there, the announcement will be made, whatever programs are being done, those programs will be completed. But, in general, no plans or programs will be announced. In general, in a way, the announcement will not be released. The government will have to make arrangements for the basic needs. For example, drinking water, animals, health, etc. In this way, the announcement will be released. And the authorities will be given the permission to conduct the election. In this way, there will be no possibility to take up the other half-time workers in the other areas. Now, the half-time workers have been done. They can be given the opportunity to complete it. But, no announcement will be released. The state government has not issued any new orders. It has not issued any new orders. It has not issued any new orders. It may have been a compromise or it may have been a compromise to some communities. It has not issued any new orders. For that reason, there is a miscellaneous inquiry that is being decided in the cabinet. It is not clear whether it was or not issued an order. Because, we have done this last night, we can claim it in the next few days. So, it is not clear whether the state government will follow the inquiry. Okay, Ravi. Stay in touch. There are updates in the inquiry. Let's give it to the people. The updates are related to the people. The real war in politics will start. Until now, practice matches were held. We are getting ready. We are getting ready for the war. It is a political war. Now, it will start in the real war. The battlefield will start. We have to see how much time we will get. How many days will we get after the election? In the war that will take place in 8 days, which weapons will be used? How many weapons will be used? Who will be the next target? We have to see. This is very important. Because, many weapons have been released before the election. 5 crore voters in the state. For the first time, more than 9 lakh people have voted. The final ballot has been sent. 5 crore voters in the state. More than 9 lakh people have voted for the first time. The final ballot has been sent. The first time, people above 80 years of age have been allowed to vote from their homes. It is not possible. It is difficult. There will be health problems. There are many viruses. In order to prevent these problems, they have given this facility to the voters. They have given this facility to the voters. 5 crore voters have voted. 9 lakh new voters have voted.

We have shown the videos of people who have come to vote for the first time. They have given us another opportunity. My brother Ravish Nandigedhar. I have a small question for people who are above 80 years of age. We have shown on the screen the days when we were conducting the elections. The time has come. We have done a great job conducting the elections. The voting percentage has reduced. We will miss all that. Arun, definitely this is happening in different states. This is happening for the first time in Karnataka. People above 80 years of age have been given the opportunity to conduct the elections. have been given the opportunity to conduct the elections. This is happening for the first time in Karnataka. We have to wait and see how much impact this will have. There are more than 17 lakh people. We have to wait and see how much vote will be made. We have to wait and see how much vote will be made. I have a question. I have a question. Will we miss a lot in this election? Will we miss a lot in the voting booths and in the voting booths?

There will be more chances of people coming to the polling stations. There will be more chances of people coming to the polling stations. There will be more chances of people coming to the polling stations. There will be more chances of people coming to the polling stations. But the police will be there to manage the situation.

 In Karnataka Vidhan Sabha election, JDS and Congress were discussing about the JDS-Congress alliance. Will Congress and JDS join hands? Will both parties join hands and give BJP a beating in Karnataka? JDS's chief, Kumar Swamy has answered this question. What did he say about the JDS-Congress alliance? Let's see in the report. The dates of Karnataka Vidhan Sabha election have been announced. Voting was held in Karnataka on 10th May. As soon as the date came, all the parties of the state joined in preparations. Before the announcement of the dates, it was said that JDS and Congress can form an alliance. There can be a dialogue between the two. The entire opposition is getting united to defeat BJP. In this case, there was hope that JDS will also support Congress. But now it is clear that JDS and Congress will fight different elections. JDS leader Kumar Swamy has said that Congress and JDS will not form an alliance in the election. He had said many times before that he will not form an alliance with any party. At the same time, Congress has also rejected this statement of JDS. Karnataka Congress leader DK Shukumar said that we neither called JDS for an alliance nor asked them to come together. People of Karnataka have decided to vote for Congress and our government will be formed here. Congress has entered the field with full force in Karnataka for the elections. The party believes that there will be no difference if there is no alliance. Congress was confident about its victory. The survey also shows that Congress government is being formed in Karnataka. But on 13th May, we will know who has won the Karnataka seat."

 Election date has been announced and 3 parties are using their own tactics and are doing circus to the candidates. So, the confidence that we will come to power in the election is on Congress. Some parties are doing circus to the candidates. They are using their own tactics and are doing circus to the candidates. This is a shock to Congress. Because, some parties are using their own tactics and are doing circus to the candidates. D.K.Shi is not a candidate for any of the parties. Why is this happening? Why is this happening? The candidates are not being named in Congress. In Congress, 4-5 people are voting for the candidates. In 4-5 parties, the candidates are not being named. No one is coming forward. Why is this happening in Congress? Let us see which 4 parties are doing this. In Madhagajugala, the candidates are not being named. In Raju's 4 parties, the candidates are not being named. Let us see which 4 parties are doing this. In the screening committee, the candidates are not being named. It is difficult to find the candidates. The Congress is not coming forward. The leaders are not coming forward. Congress is not coming forward. What is the meaning of giving the candidates to Congress? After winning the candidates, who should be named? If the candidates are not being named, what is the meaning? Why is this happening in Congress? Let us see which 4 parties are doing this. Congress is not coming forward. If the candidates are not being named, who should be named? The leaders of the KPCC are not coming forward. The leaders of the KPCC are not coming forward. The leaders of the KPCC are not coming forward. What is the meaning of giving candidates to Congress? This is the question. They have already finalized the candidates for 124 seats. They have finalized the candidates for 124 seats. In 60 seats, DK Shukumar and Sidh Ramayana will be there. They have given the candidates to the KPCC. They announced 124 seats. There was no dispute. They announced 124 seats. There will be 60 seats in the next 100 seats. They are making a big fuss about that. If there is a fight for 4 seats, there will be no candidates for 4 seats. Why did Congress go to such a situation? Congress has won all the other 24 seats. Congress is shocked. They are giving candidates to all the other seats. First, they are giving candidates to the KPCC. In Chennapatta, Congress has not given any candidate. They said they will bring Ramya and make him stand. They did not know where he came from. They are telling him to bring anyone and make him stand. Operation Kamala was going on. Three people from Congress went to see it. Sudhakar from Chikbalapur, Somshekar from Eshwantpur, KR Pura. Congress had a strong base. But since three people went there, Congress is in a bit of a pickle. Face and money. They are playing with the hands to make him stand. Some people who showed interest in the beginning, They said they know that they will win. They are saying that they will not stand. They said they will stand and win. But in the end, they are showing their charm. They are not showing their interest. They are going to find new people. Congress is in a bit of a pickle. In Chennapatta, they said they will bring Suresh and make Ramya stand. Suresh said he will not stand. Ramya is not coming. But these three people who went to see Operation Kamala. Who will they bring? Sukesh will give more details. If you look at it, Congress is trying to hold the power of power. They are struggling day and night. What if Congress or this party does not get any votes in all four states? Since the last two days, the screening committee has been made. They have made the final ballot. In the first 124 ballots, there were no votes. In the current 100 ballots, even though they have finalized 50-odd names, there are still no votes in all four states. The reason for the lack of votes is that the Congress party has a history of 130 years. In a state that has become popular in Karnataka or South Karnataka, there are no votes in all four states. It is a fact that there is a lack of votes. So, they have decided to try hard and make someone stand. So, Congress wants to see a party that has no votes in all four states. So, Congress has decided to make a candidate who can stand for a few votes. And a search is also going on for a candidate. This seems like a weapon of the last days. So, Congress has decided to make a candidate in all four states. From the perspective of the party's prestige, it is clear that they have made a candidate. So, when will the second list be announced? Will they release the 100 candidates who are in the second list? So, it is necessary to find candidates in all four states urgently. Definitely, Vidhya. The CEC meeting is held daily on 4th or 5th. It is not yet over. It will be known in two days or so. In the process of reaching the Congress, even if they want to finalize the candidates in all four states, it is possible to make the list of 10-15 states pending. To make the list of candidates in all three states. If they do not do that, they will make the list of candidates in all four states. And it is possible to make the list of candidates in all four states after the election. Even if they say that they will make the list of 100 candidates in the second list, it is possible to make the list of candidates pending in all four states."

 Good evening, I'm Shreya Dhondyal. I'm coming to you from outside the Vidhan Sauda here in Bangalore, the seat of power in Karnataka. Election campaigning has intensified in the state and it is being predicted to be a two-cornered fight between the BJP and the Congress with the JDS hoping to play Kingmaker. So over the next 30 minutes or so, I'm speaking to politicians and citizens about which way they think Karnataka is going to vote. Will they vote on caste, will they vote on corruption or will they vote on communalism? In India, predicting an election is always fraught with risks. But it is being said that the Congress will do well this time. In any case, over decades, their vote share in the state has been 35% or above. This time, team Congress is being led by a pair of rivals. Mr. Sardaramaiah, who's a former chief minister and DK Shivakumar, who's Mr. Moneybags and Mr. Muscleman as well. Question is, who's going to be the chief ministerial face of the Congress? Who's going to be the chief minister if the Congress wins this election? I put that question today to DK Shivakumar and let's just say his answer was anything but diplomatic. Mr. Shivkumar, thank you very much for your time here on Mirna. One of the challenges that the Congress is facing in the Karnataka elections, apart from the others, is who's the Congress's chief ministerial face? There are two claimants. Are you one of the claimants? See, I don't know why media is portraying all the claimants. Rahul Gandhi and the Congress president, Mr. Malik Ajay Karage has made it very clear. This is an election on collective leadership. So we are running the election on a collective leadership. Earlier we had gone through Mr. Sidramaiah in the last assembly election, but ultimately we could not succeed. So they brought me as the president when Mr. Sidramaiah resigned as the leader of the opposition and Mr. Dinesh Gundrao resigned as the party president. Srimati Sonia Gandhi appointed me as the president in the worst time of the Karnataka politics. From that day to day, I think you all are speaking on the chief ministerial post. That means the Congress party is coming to power. So I'm very happy you all have confidence that Congress will come to power. I don't know, sir. Let's see. But has there been some sort of understanding with Mr. Sidramaiah, if this is collective leadership that the Congress is working with? Is there some sort of understanding? Forget the infighting. If and when the time comes to appoint a chief minister, we'll just split it. We'll do two years in two years or two and a half years in two and a half years. No such understanding has been taken place. We are in a collective leadership. We'll fight together. We are joined together. Our duty is to see that Congress party comes to power and we will give a very effective government with a governance. You're saying your full concentration right now will be for the Congress party to come to power. But your opposition is a mighty opposition with many, many hands and many more resources than you have. What's your plan? What's the plan? We do not match them with any resources or their master plan or master strategy. But our resources is the strength of the people. Whatever the double engine government was there, whatever the mighty government was there, we are able to prove to the state, we are able to prove to the voters that this engine has failed and no more they can't keep up the image what Karnataka has. Karnataka is a state where we had a very big image. The country had, the entire world used to look at India and India through Bangalore and Karnataka. Now that has gone, it has become the corruption capital of this country. A country with, has lost its image through Karnataka. We have to somehow restore the glory of Karnataka and Bangalore. But you know, the counter flip side to that argument, Mr. Shivakumar, is the fact that you yourself have corruption charges against you. The Prime Minister on multiple occasions has stepped out and said, this is ""Bhrashtachar Bachao"" Andolan. The entire, you know, effort to save Rahul Gandhi is all ""Bhrashtacharis"", all opposition parties who are corrupt are coming together to launch this Andolan. My chair, the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister were asking for a witness. The LOKI has given a witness. The contract associate president, Mr. Kepanna, who has two and a half lakh members in it has officially said on record with you and the entire state that without 40 percent there is no commission. When we said that we pay CM, they could not reply. They were asking for an evidence. The LOKI has given an evidence. What more do you need? So they wanted to cover up. They are just trying to bring things emotionally, on caste, on division, on a lot of polarization things. But people are fed up with this. People have decided to root out Karnataka, root out BJP in Karnataka. See on 10th, May 10th, is not a day of election. It is the day which they are going to root out Karnataka, root out corruption in Karnataka, for a good governance in Karnataka, for a change of state and the party in Karnataka. So it is a very important day. It is not only the election day. It is, we are going to see that Karnataka will have a change with a good administrative government, whatever we have promised we will fulfill. Mr. Shivakumar, but then the charge is going to be how can the Congress and Mr. Shivakumar talk about corruption when the ED is after him, when there are charges of money laundering against him? I agree. They planted a story. They planted a case against me when Mr. Amit Patel's election was there. They sent me. They raided me. They have fixed a false case, a political case, which has been, they wanted to tarnish me. They want to pressurize me. I did not yield to them. I had to stand loyalty to my party, whatever the direction my party had given me that day to save the MLAs in Karnataka. I do that. At that point of time, they raided and they applied a case. I'm fighting out. I believe in the law of this country. Justice will prevail upon me. All the opposition, they are not teaching any single opponent parties. Only they are using this ED, income tax, whatever is there. Today morning, I was speaking to one of my friend, a business friend of mine. He's just afraid. He wants to connect or disconnect a phone. They have all threatened him. They have all warned him. No one should speak to them. No one should help them. So this type of pressure politics, and they're threatening all my friends and well-wishers. No one is trying to pick my phone. This is the situation we want in this country. And if anyone wants to speak to their children or their family or their friends, they want to speak on FaceTime. They want to speak on WhatsApp. This is what this country is facing. You've spoken about pressure on you from the BJP. Was there pressure on you to quit the Congress and join the BJP at any point of time, sir? Oh my God, there is a big story behind it. I think you have to ask some of the BJP friends. I don't want to tell. I don't want to be. I don't want to be active. They wanted me to leave this Congress party. A lot of things are there. But I stand by loyalty to the Congress party and the leadership. I'm a congressman. I'll die as a congressman. So you're telling me there was pressure on you to quit the Congress and join the BJP, sir? Yes, of course. Of course. Of course. And when was this pressure? I don't want to disclose the names, the confidential name, who all have spoken. I don't want to disclose. Lot, lot, three, four years, it was, it is running like anything. And everyone in the state knows about it. Can I ask you then, you know, what you make of the BJP's move? Including, I'm telling, including an officer who is at the rank of the DG, I'm telling you. They, I know what they pressurized me, how they pressurized me. I just, I gave an interview on some TV. I picked a jail than having a deputy CM post that was on record. So you were offered the deputy CM's post. Yes. And that was the reason for dumping the Congress party and joining the BJP? Yes, yes, yes. Okay. Can I ask you, moving ahead, can I ask you what you make of the BJP's moves to give 2% additional quotas to the Lingayats and Volkaligars? Do you think it's a masterstroke or do you think it's a? It is a masterstroke. It is an election, fox, call. Nothing will happen. No one will, or guaranteed vote. They just created enemies in this country. They created enemies that in the, see, you have a constitution. You have to respect all section of the society. You have to give a share, share, you have to share, you have to care. See they had, minorities had 4%. Lingayat and Volkaligars demanded as per the population. We have given for Shudra caste, Shudra tribe as per the rights and the population. So the Volkaligars divided about, asked for 14 to 16%. Lingayat also divided, asked for 16 to 17%. Now they feel that we are beggars. No more Volkaligars and Lingayats are beggars. We will rectify whatever the mistake that been done, whatever the decision has been taken. Nothing can be proved in the court of law. Everything will go out. It is an election gimmick. They will fail and they will be answerable and people of the state will answer to them and root them out. You are calling this an election gimmick. Is this a gimmick you will overturn if the Congress is voted to power? 100%. We will overturn, see that justice will prevail upon everyone. Equal rights has to be given as per the population. There is a constitution, there is a Supreme Court judgment. We will have to stand by it. Mr. Shiv Kumar, you are saying you have a plan, you have a strategy. The BJP has Prime Minister Modi. Arguably the best election campaigner this country has seen in a very, very long time. Will you be pitching in Rahul Gandhi, you know, to counter the impact that Prime Minister Modi gets to almost every election in this country? See you are asking about the Prime Minister and Prime Minister leadership in Karnataka. It will not work out in Karnataka. See he came for an inauguration of Kempe Gowda statue at the airport. He came in his government plane and he went back. The cost of the statue is 60 crores, mind boggling. But do you know the expenditure for his inauguration function? It is 30 crores. Six crores has been paid for buses for the people to come, for the students to come. Six crores for the pendal, for the road. Thirty crores officially. Whose money? Why 30 crores? It is the common man's money. It is the taxpayer's money. I don't know whether he looks at it. He himself, he has to look at it. He has to be a model. The airport people have created every one and they would have done. Why government should do? Government is a part of the private entrepreneurs. They will do. We have given them land. They are earning money. I think this within the nose of the Prime Minister, all these things are going on. He is promoting corruption. I am very sorry to tell this. You are saying the Prime Minister is promoting corruption? That is what. See for his inauguration, you should ask how he spent. What is the need of spending 30 crores for a Prime Minister for a launching of a statue - Kempegoda statue? The airport people would have done it. He came there, then he went to inaugurate the airport there. The internal, the new second terminal, they would have done and they would have spent on that. Why government should spend on it? The airport is not government's airport. It is a private airport. We have only a small share in it. I was an urban development minister. I know how he gave the share to that. But if it's a big infrastructure project, if the Prime Minister is coming, how can that be a bad thing? No, I am telling you, the airport people would have done it. Why government should spend its own money for a statue? Even the statue money would have been done, it is in the airport premises. They would have done, the airport people have done it. You are the chairman, government is the chairman of that with a small 16 or 13 percent share. That's all. The central government and state government, we have only 25 percent. 75 percent are the private players. Why are you investing there? This is not a very, I am telling you, the entire, in days to come, today my brother, the member of parliament, he has come out on record. What is the investment done for a statue? What is the investment done on a private? Six crores money for bringing people for their political function. It is not a government function. It is… But all political parties do it across the country. All political parties do it. No, all political, but not at this point of time and not at this point of time. After prime ministers coming to various functions, home ministers coming, I think they might have spent more than 200 crores. Mr. Shivakumar, thank you very much for your time here on Mirror Now. Good to speak to you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, sir. Namaskar, namaskar. In India, they often say, when you cast your vote, you vote your caste. In Karnataka, the caste with the most are the Lingayats. Within the Lingayats, there are 99 sub-castes. And before every election, there are internal dynamics that play out between these sub-castes. And that is exactly what is happening this time. The Panchamashali Lingayats form a bulk of the Lingayat community. And they have been demanding an increase in their reservation. Right ahead of the elections, the BJP has given them 2% plus quota, which means their reservation has been upped by 2%. But where has this 2% come from? Well, it's been taken away from the Muslims. The Muslim quota of 4%, the BJP has scrapped that and distributed 2% to the Panchamashali Lingayats and the other 2% to the Vokhaligas. Are the Panchamashali Lingayats happy with that? No, they aren't. They are calling it an eye wash. They are saying this is not the real Mahaprasad that they wanted. I spoke to one of the most influential Panchamashali Lingayats here in Bangalore, and this is what he told me. Swamiji, thank you for speaking to us. Tell us, the Lingayats are a powerful community. They have a voice in Karnataka. Out of 23 chief ministers in this state, 10 have been Lingayats. Then why is the community saying it's marginalized and they want quota and your election issue is quota again, as always? Out of all the chief ministers, Lingayat has the largest majority of the Panchamashali community. The Panchamashali community has only been taken by the vote bank. They haven't done anything for the community. We are not asking for a political reservation. We are asking for our children, our youth, for jobs and education. Our voice is not for politics. Our children should get good education and jobs. Out of the 85% of the Panchamashali community, only 5-6% live in urban areas. Most of the children and people have not received proper education. But your community has money, political representation, influence. Will you also ask for a quota? Everyone else will ask for it. Everyone has money now. But our children are farmer-based. Because of that, sometimes floods occur. Have farmers ever become rich in the country? We are the children of farmers, the Panchamashali, the Lingayats. That's why central OBC is the most important for our children. All the communities in the state have received central OBC. On what basis have they received central OBC? Because of that, our children are not getting medical seats, are not getting neat exams, and the IAS, IFAS, IFS have become a cloud. That's why our demand is that we fight for the reservation of 27% of the central OBC. So you want to go from the general category to the OBC category. That's the ultimate aim. We are in OBC in the state, not in central. All the communities in the state are already in OBC. But you have received 2% of the OBC, 2% from you, 2% from the local government, and 2% from the Muslim quota. Are you happy with that? Of course we are happy. But we are happy when we get central OBC. Last question. The Lingayat sect was born out of the Bhakti movement. Its roots are in social justice and equal representation. Don't you think that you and Vukalegas have been given the right to be Muslims? No, not at all. Because the Muslims in Karnataka, wherever you go in the state, no one has got reservation on the basis of religion. Especially in Karnataka. And that Muslim community is in category 1, category 2A, and 2B. So they are getting reservation in three categories. But Lingayat is the only one. The population wise, it was very less. That's why we have given 2%. And the Muslims have been given the right to be Muslims in category 1, 2A, and also the economic development section. Don't you think that this election is a bribery? It came before the election. Look, this is a win-win situation. Everyone has their own selfishness. And I say, a little selfishness and the rest is the ultimate. Okay, thank you. You've heard from the Lingayats. Now let's hear from the Muslims. The argument is simple on the other side. They say, if the BJP's logic is, that religion-based quota is not allowed by the constitution, then why is it that only Muslim quota in the state has been scrapped, and not the quota for Jains or Christians in the state? I went to Bilal Masjid this evening to see some students there. This is what they told me. Bilal Masjid here in Bangalore, speaking to some students. Tell me, first of all, what do you make of this entire quota-shifting business that has happened? That the 4% quota for Muslims has been taken away and given to the Bokharigas and the Lingayats. How did you see that move? Yes, so the recent move of state government of scrapping 4% reservation, sorry, reservation of Muslims, and providing it to the other communities is completely a political move from the government. And we see that the upcoming state assembly election is also near. So our view is that it is a completely move, seeing the upcoming election. And another thing we see here is to bring a rift between the communities also can be seen. Wherein, if they were genuine, if they had to provide a reservation to a community, to a particular community, they could have given a reservation from other bases. Instead of taking a reservation from one particular community and splitting it to other two communities. So you are saying only the reservation and the quota for Muslims has been taken away, but it continues to be there for the Jains and the Christians. Yes, yes, it's true. And on the other side, if you see Ranganath Mishra report, it says that religious minorities should be provided reservation. And moreover, it says 10% of the reservation should be provided to these religious minorities. So there's another side of the reservation too. It's not only for the, we cannot say it cannot be given to a religious group. Rather it's for a socially backward group or a community. Okay. Can I ask you then what your issues will be when you vote in this election? So primarily what I as a student see for the upcoming elections is the main discussion point should be education, employment and the human rights violation which is happening. So these are the basic demands from the student community. For example, if you see the education sector, there are many loopholes in the present education system. We need to improve that. We need to improve or provide better facilities in the educational institutions, strengthen the public universities. That should be our demand rather than this divisive politics. Okay. What about you? Pooja, I'll come to you in just a bit. What about you? How do you feel about this entire quota tinkering business that has happened right before the elections? I just feel it's a communal tackle. Basically, we see in the last one year, not one year, last three years from the government which came, they have playing with the communal angles with the various castes and religions. They have specially targeted on group of minorities for their communal agenda. I think it's a part of that agenda to segregate the part of one community. Okay, so you're saying Tipu happened, then the hijab thing happened, then the beef, halal, all of that. Etc. And it's a continuous part of that agenda to segregate the community and segregate between the two communities and castes. That's what I think. So it's polarization. We usually see it before elections. Pooja, how do you feel about the polarization being a Hindu? And being a student and being a citizen of this country. And being a woman, definitely. Especially after this government has come, it's not only a threat or it's not just creating violence based on religion, but also as a woman, we have a lot of restrictions in terms of even hijab. And recently BJP MP said, ""Oh, you're not kept bindi."" ""Are you a Hindu woman? Is your husband dead?"" And such remarks, you know. It's very common to not wear a bindi or wear a bindi for any Indian Hindu girl. Okay, right now I'm not wearing one. So it's basically our choice whether I want to wear a jeans. So I'm actually scared if BJP comes into power again, will they ask us to wear a saree all the time? I mean, I like wearing a saree, but that does not mean that every day you ask me to wear it as a restrictive thing. Secondly, we are asking this reservation for a very long time. The Okaliga and Lingayat, even if we are asking reservation, we are asking for a very long time. But this move has come very late now, when the election is like one month away. Okay, thank you. Good to speak to all of you. Thank you. Caste and religion are just two of the many, many factors at play in the Karnataka elections. There are civic issues as well, issues that touch the lives of citizens every day. I met one of Bangalore's most prominent and well-respected citizens, Dr. Sudha Moorthy, and I asked her on what basis will she vote in this election? What is her big issue? This is what she told me. I'll leave you with that. Thanks for watching. Dr. Sudha Moorthy, as a citizen of Karnataka, you're headed into an election. I'm not going to ask you who you're going to vote for. I want to ask you what you will vote for. I will vote for the right causes. Which are? You know, being a teacher, I care for rural education, opportunities for the rural people, more concerned with rural background, anything which helps them, I'll vote for that. As a Bangalorean, what are your concerns about the city? It's a fantastic city. It was once upon a time a pension paradise, but infrastructure is very bad. And we spend so much time in traffic. So you are never on time in any meeting, either too early or too late."

 Even after the Mislati's decision, the fight between Congress and BJP has intensified. There was a serious discussion about the Shikaripura Galaathe in the core committee. BJP brother who is leading the Congress in Mysore, what is the reason? Congress's Mislati weapon, BJP's B.C. gun. There were many protests in Mysore in the core committee. Mislati, in the current election, the bank robbery of the Mata bank has become a big weapon of the BJP Congress. BJP, who has been defeated by Mislati's weapon, has seriously underestimated the Shikaripura Galaathe. Now, the core committee has a discussion about the Galaathe. The local leaders who have been able to sustain successfully have not been informed. BJP is doing their best to win the hearts of the community. Congress, which has been using the same weapon that Mislati used to attack, has protested in Mysore today. In the name of saving the constitution and saving the country, the leaders of Siddhu Seri were fortunate in the protest. They opened a bank against BJP. Do more for the workers. Do more for the people who are in need. If you want to do, reform the constitution, reform it, join the 9 schedules, now there is a 50% ceiling, right? Relax that ceiling and do more. The castes are fighting each other. 4% for Muslims, 2% for Lingayats. 2% for the workers. What kind of justice is this? Have you heard of it? Have you heard of it? Have you heard of it? The BJP government is still fooling us. DKC has promised not to give anything. Mislati has taken a small amount and increased it by 2%. They have given us what we don't want. The CMs are always fooling people. We have announced in the election that we will give the ST category to the Kodi community. So, we don't have any ST category. We have asked for 15% or 16% for the lawyers. Panchamshala has also asked. We have taken it from them and given 2-2%. We have asked them to give it after the population has been counted. We have said that we will reduce that. We have not done it in the name of law. In the voting, it is enough if Mislati increases it. Congress has promised to add it to the schedule. Congress is using it as a weapon to create a rift between the BJP and the Kodi community. This was a big blow to the BJP. It is a challenge to Mislati. Bureau report TV 9 9."

 The Chief Minister has always been a person who pulls people. He has given the bus pass to the women, he has spoken about the manifesto, his budget is over. Nothing has happened. I remember the election that was held recently. Baburao Chitrasinghe was called and asked to speak at the election time. No SD category was there. That is why Baburao Chitrasinghe has become a big issue for the Boli community. We have asked for 15% and 16% from the lawyers. Pancham Shalya has also asked. We have asked for 7-8% from him. We are saying that the Congress party has given us 7-8% from them. We are not satisfied with that. We have decided to give the society what we have today by taking away the small numbers. We are not saying that you should take away the others. We have said that we will reduce the number of people. We have to talk about the Parishadis. They are the ones who have to be punished. You have to do it according to the law. Whatever you do, do it according to the law. Do not do it according to the law. All the other CMs have gone to their respective CMs and they are saying that they are the ones who have given them the benefit. They are saying that they have to pay for it. So, in this month, all the decisions that have been taken, all the decisions have to be taken in this month. The result of the elections is that we have also made a few mistakes in the past. So, all the people are giving answers like this. That is why I am saying specifically that we are not doing the work of repairing the mistakes that they have done. All the societies should be given justice. They should not give anything to the people. There is nothing wrong in that. They should not give. So, it is not right to take away the others and take away the other society. When is the CEC meeting? We have a CEC meeting tomorrow. We are going there. We have meetings on the 4th. Everything is going on. When do you think the meeting will be held? I am not the one who is going to hold the CEC meeting. Mallikarjan Kherge is going to sign it. After he signs it. Sir, is there no problem in all the candidates? All of them are there. There is a lot of tension. Sir, in some of the parties, there is a saying that we are giving Samudra Yudhra Rajanam. All of them are blackmailers. Congress party. All the parties have done it. BJP has done it. Why have they kept the list of candidates as if it is an announcement? They are announcing it on 7th and 5th. There are internal problems in the people. Last time, the last time there was a protest in KR Pettai. They have given Rajanam. We have joined the party. Madhubangalappa has joined. All the people who have stood up for the other parties have joined. JDS has joined. Yesterday, BJP went to the MLA and joined. They have come to our party and asked. We have come to them and told them that we have become anti-incumbency because of you. They have joined us and we are protesting. So, in all the parties, they are protesting against BJP. Sir, in HNS, there is a saying that BJP and JDS are joining Congress. But in the Valasikashechwar inquiry, they have come to the church. Sir, will they join Congress? I am not going to talk about all that. If you ask me, I will tell you. Sir, the people who are in the party are saying that there is a fight going on. Yes, see. Whoever is a congress member, they have said that there is a fight going on. The department has also given a reason for that. Sir, is Rahul Gandhi's campaign going to be fixed by next year and then we can move forward? We have a request to the people of 4th and 5th. We will make a film from Delhi. Sir, you have to give a reason for the fight. You have to give a reason for the fight. Siddharaman has also said that he has heard about it from both the parties. What is the opportunity for both the parties? I will give a reason. You ask. I will also ask. I will give a reason. [Ending music]"

 First of all, Congress officials will not come. They will sit in the seats that are not there. This is very clear. Congress is fighting for the right to become the CM. They have not done anything good for the people of Karnataka. And there is no surprise to what Siddaramma said. If it happens in the inner circle, it is a miracle. On one side, DK Sukumar has said in all the assemblies that he wants to become the CM. He said that he will make Siddaramma the CM. But the CM will be made by the people. He will make the MLAs the CM. They do not have any two in their minds. Today, in the Rajya Samiti meeting, the meeting of the District Court Committee was discussed in the last two days. The further screening of the meeting will be done today. The meeting will be held in the Central. The meeting will be held on 8th. The final decision will be taken. Today, in the Halwar area, our officials are very enthusiastic. And when we look at the development of the last three to four months, in the case of the Dunavani meeting, there are all the signs that the majority will come. Some areas have given surprising results. We will see that in the coming days. Now, in our Karakartur Assembly, our leaders have also given the same. And the ticket giving has also been done by the people. From the local area, the district and the state meetings, all the opinions have been gathered and the complete information has been done on the ground reality. Now, I believe that it will be very easy. Now, what should be done in the Halwar area, it will be done."

Shiv Kumar I can't see your nose, it's getting dirty Anti-activist, Kanchanali Ravi Kumar Ravi Kumar has discussed about the election What will the people say when he does it? Will JDS and BJP support me? If they do, we will do the election We need to see the public opinion People have called me after the story Because people don't trust JDS candidates They are fix on Girayakant and D.K. Suresh That's why they say, they should have announced it as a common, honest program They are still looking for this issue in Kanakpur, right? They can announce it in Kanakpur, JDS is there, right? Kumar Swamy is committing a lot of mistakes Has anyone in the district panchayat ever called JDS and asked for a vote? Has anyone? No? No Why didn't you vote? I will vote, I will get 2 lakhs What 2 lakhs? You will get it, right? Yes, I will get it You should have done it, right? Yes The people who called for the election, 50-60 thousand people called for the election Did you vote for JDS? Yes, for JDS You should have given it to the candidates You have seen the doubts that everyone is asking for it, right? You should have given it to them I didn't give it to them, they asked me to come and announce it I told them that if you don't vote, you will get a deposit from BJP There is no BJP here Then see, DK Shivakumar vs Kanchanalli Ravi Kumar Why did I say that? The people are not changing The heart war is just beginning That is the reason Even if I give 100 acres of land, I will not agree with DK When DK Shivakumar went to jail, he was not able to get a bus or a benke Ravi Kumar is the one who has taken the case of building a fort in the court Ravi Kumar has done a lot of social protests Ravi Kumar has protested for the solution of Kanakpur's flood Ravi Kumar has protested for the solution of Ashilur village's panchayat's flood Ravi Kumar has protested for the solution of DKS Shivakumar's Bembali Ravi Kumar is not a king, he is a politician He is standing here We have spoken to him and he has also thought about it He is a hard worker What can we do? Do you know what? India is not respected if it is against the power India should not win against the power India should not win against the power India should not win against the power DK Shivakumar is a respected person I want to tell Kumar Swamy to do more Kumar Swamy, we should protest against the tiger Not against the power I am not good, you are not good I want to be a good candidate and protest I want to hear If you want to protest against the tiger, you should come to DK Shivakumar's chandapada DK Shivakumar is a king, he should run He is the CEO of BBC He should run in Kanakpur if he wants to be strong I have told you If you want to win, you should be strong DK Shivakumar has won in 80,000 leads In 79,000 leads, he should win in 1 lakh leads Ravi Kumar is not possible If Ravi Kumar supports BJP and JDS, it will be a good fight If it happens, DK will win I am saying that Ravi Kumar will win is a big lie If a real man is in Kanakpur, he can vote JDS and BJP will be candidates Ravi Kumar should support them So, DK Shivakumar will win in Kanakpur He will win DK will win DK Suresh will win in 1 lakh leads I have written that he should not lose hope and trust in India He should win in the right place [Music]"

 BJP government has done injustice to us. The government's heinous act of discrimination against the oppressed. The head of the society is upset about the injustice done to the government. When I was studying in Kalburgi, I found 1 crore rupees in my car. I found the money when I took it to Mudapur from Kalburgi. I have the money. I am taking it to pay my labour. In Yadagiri district, Surapura, a group of social movements are protesting. Muslim community is a social and educational backward society.

 BSY has been accused of using stones to get rid of the political pressure. DKK Shukkumar, the BJP leader, is a scoundrel. CM Gondalava was accused of being a moustache. What does it mean if BSY is accused of using stones? DKK Shukkumar has reacted by saying that BSY is being used to get rid of the political pressure. What does it mean if BSY is accused of using stones? Edurapp is not the CM. Edurapp is not the government's representative. The CM has created a big ruckus in the Moustache issue. Have you learnt from the Freedom app and opened a hardware shop? If so, what are the expenses for those who have used Freedom app for more than 1 crore? The Home Minister has to return Edurapp to the Central stage. He has to accept that we have neglected his leadership. He has to go home, have breakfast, and pay his bills. He has all the necessary documents. We have gone to the Church. If Edurapp is accused of using stones, what is the reason? This is a new tactic of BJP to go to the Central stage. They have to finish Edurapp. They have to finish him politically. They have to do it in his house. If the CM has used stones in his house, it is fine. If the CM has used stones in the house, it is fine. But if they do it in Edurapp's house, it is an internal fight. BJP has no connection with the Central stage. I have spoken to Edurapp's people and they have given their opinion. I am saying this as a party leader. This is a scandal in the state. The Supreme Court has given a judgement against the law. The two ministers have sat against it and said that they have done it in the cabinet. Where is the backward class commission? The interim report was given in December. Is it possible to make a judgement in the interim report? The Constitution has to be amended. There may be internal regulations and other things. It has to be done with proper procedure. They have done a gimmick for the election. They have a small number of people in this country. They have a large population. They asked Swamiji to give them. We have asked him. He has given us a reservation of 12% and 15% on the basis of the population. They have given us 2% and given us 4% extra. What extra have they given? How much is the population based on the population? How much is the population based on the bravery? They have given us a special model. They have given us a model based on the 56% population. They have given it to two communities. They have given us the 4% extra. Why are you doing it by taking it from them? You are giving food. You have studied in Freedom app and opened a hardware shop. If so, why are you giving your products to a Freedom app provider who is worth 1 crore? Why are you doing this? We are brave people. We are social workers. Why are you troubling us? Don't trouble us. They are behind us. We don't agree to anything. Our government will come after 40 days. We will scrap everything."

 Congress Election Committee meeting before the break of 2nd day. Today, DKC Siddaramaiah, who is on the stage, has announced the expansion of 60 to 80 constituencies. AC officials have held a strong room meeting. The strong room in Taluk's Madhagondana hall, Government's first-class college. Behind the committee meeting, a strong room meeting was held. Bagehari has won the ticket to the throne. Devagodara's leadership committee has not yet been decided. Kumar Swamy and Bhavani are not able to do it. The rightful claim is with Eshwarappa. Those who have worked with him have not been asked for the ticket. They have asked for the ticket for their son. KS Eshwarappa has been opposed by 500 people. KSVP is the political party for the Karnataka Assembly elections. BJP's Telugu actor Pawan Kalyan is likely to be the candidate. BJP is planning to promote Pawan Kalyan in the areas where Telugu speakers are more. Happy Chintha Neth!"

 The person you are watching in the video, throwing money like flowers, tell me he is none other than the Congress President of Karnataka, D.K. Shivkumar. Who during a rally in Mandya, took 500 rupees notes on people, whose video is going viral. Tell me the reason for the video being viral is also that D.K. Shivkumar is also rising as the CM of Congress in Karnataka. While watching the video, many people are also raising this question. The money that should be invested in the welfare of the people, that money Congress leaders are spilling like water. As a politician, how much is it right to pour money on artists? Even when there is an election atmosphere in the state. Let's tell the whole matter. This matter has come out of Srirangapatna, Karnataka. Where D.K. Shivkumar from Congress side, participated in the democratic movement. When is this viral video being told? In the video, during the Congress leader rally, the bus is seen climbing. Meanwhile, the Congress leader suddenly takes out the car of the notes, and starts throwing it on the people standing below. Although the information that has come out, it is believed that the Congress leader was pouring this money on the artists above the bus in a helpless state. Not on the public. On the other hand, D.K. Shivkumar is the Congress President in Karnataka. It is also being speculated that if power comes in the state, then Shivkumar can be the first choice for the post of Chief Minister. And for this reason, Shivkumar went to Mandya to do road show and publicity. Let us tell that before this viral video, Shivkumar Raj's DGP, Praveed Sood, had also come in the discussions on saying that he is useless. Along with giving this statement on DGP, Shivkumar had also claimed that Praveed Raj is defending the BJP government. And filing a case against the leaders of his party. Along with this claim, Shivkumar had also warned during this time that if his party comes into power, then action will be taken against them. Currently, this video of D.K.
